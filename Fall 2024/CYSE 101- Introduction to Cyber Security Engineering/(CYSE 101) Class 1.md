Here we go...

I cannot stand this course, and the lecture hasn't even started yet. Maybe it will be fun. Let yourself believe that it might be fun. Anything is possible.

Instructor seems like a bro. I should be able to talk to him about creative ways to not take this course.

We talked about nothing. Oof.

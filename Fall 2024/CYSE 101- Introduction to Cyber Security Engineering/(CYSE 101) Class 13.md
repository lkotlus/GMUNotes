### Mobile device/IoT security
- Frequently overlooked, very important.
- Comparison
	- Mobile devices:
		- Roaming devices that include an operating system such as IOS or android.
		- Smart phones, tablets, Raspberry Pi (grey area)
	- Embedded devices:
		- Computer in another device
		- Cars, refrigerators
	- IoT:
		- Internet connected devices that do not run a full OS
		- Cameras, medical devices, thermostats
- IoT is frequently overlooked in terms of security.
- Mobile security issues:
	- Mobile operating systems
	- Jailbreaing (rooting)
	- Malicious apps
	- Lack of updates
	- Zero days/exploits (Pegasus!)
- Embedded systems security issues:
	- Update (if possible)
		- Firmware
		- Software?
	- Adding layers of security such as a firewall
- IoT Security Issues:
	- Lack of transparency
		- Do you know what specific actions your IoT device is doing?
		- Isolate device in a VPN to see (complex)
	- IoT transformed into IoE (Internet of Everything)
		- Unsecured entry points
		- Supply chain attacks possible; not just end devices
	- Lack of regulations and governance
		- What about privacy vs. security needs?
- Mobile Device Management (MDM) Concepts and Practices:
	- Application content management
	- Remote wipe
	- Goefencing
	- Geolocation
	- Screen locks
	- Passwords/pins
	- Biometrics
	- Context-aware authentication
	- OS Updates
	- Full device encryption
- IoT Security Best Practices:
	- Track and manage devices
	- Patching and remediation
	- Update passwords from the default
	- Enable encryption if possible
	- Conduct pen tests
	- Segment your network
	- Use MFA
- Two ways to view IoT security:
	- Inward security:
		- Forucus on potential harms to health, safety, and privacy of the device users and their property stemming from compromised IoT devices and systems
		- IoT device is the final target
	- Outward security:
		- Focus on harm to other devices with IoT as a stepping stone (lateral movement).
- Data privacy:
	- Destruction and media sanitization
		- Burning
		- Shredding
		- Pulping
		- Pulverizing (crush and reduce materials like hard drives)
		- Degaussing (use a strong magnetic field)
		- Purging (software and hardware techniques to remove data from storage devices making it difficult to recover)
		- Wiping (overwrites the existing data on a storage medium multiple times with random or predetermined patterns to make original data unable to recover)
	- Sensitive labeling and handling
		- Confidential
		- Private
		- Public
		- Proprietary
		- PII (personal identification information)
		- PHI (personal health information)

### Operations Security (OPSEC)
- How we protect our valuable assets (commonly used in military settings)
- What is it?
	- Systematic and proven process by which we protect valuable assets.
- Risk Management (OPSEC) Process:
	- Identification of critical information
	- Analysis of threats
	- Analysis of vulnerabilities
	- Assessment of risks
	- Application of countermeasures
	- Repeat
- Risk Control Strategies
	- Avoidance
		- Prevent exploitation (patches)
	- Mitigation
		- Reduce impact (spares, restrict access)
	- Transference
		- Shift risk (insurance, outsourcing)
	- Acceptance
		- Do nothing (we don't care about a meteorite that will hit us no matter what we do)
- Formula:
	- $P(E|V,T)$
	- Cool.
- Example:
	- $P(E|V,T)=0.7$ in the next 24 hours.
	- Impact is $1,000,000
	- $P(E|V,T)*I=\text{cost}=\text{\$}700,000$
- Examples to support OPSEC process
	- Overarching security policy
	- Acceptable use policy (what employees can or can't do)
	- Security awareness training policy (train employees)
	- Clean desk policy (no sticky notes with passwords)
	- Mobile device policy (special mobile device software or company phones)
	- Business continuity plan (how the business continues after an incident)
	- Disaster recovery policy (how the business recovers from a disaster)
	- Incident response procedure (how the cyber people respond to an attack)
- Cringe.

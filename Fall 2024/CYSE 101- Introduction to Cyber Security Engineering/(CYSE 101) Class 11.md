### Operating system security!
- Horrible, horrible flashbacks to CYSE 211
- Attack surface
	- All points of entry
- Why do we worry about OS security?
	- Stupid question, the OS is basically everything.
	- Wide attack surface
	- In charge of memory allocation for all programs, security of users, etc.
	- Tons of bugs, vulnerabilities, millions of parallel processes, etc.
- How to secure:
	- Remove unnecessary services, accounts, etc.
	- Patch management
	- Block viruses, malware, and attacks
		- Antivirus
			- Signature vs. Behavior vs. Reputation
				- Signature: I see that this matches a malware in my database!
				- Behavior: You are very clearly attempting to encrypt the root directory, stop it!
				- Reputation: Have I seen you on other systems? No?! Suspicious!
		- Antimalware
		- HIDS/HIPS
	- Scanners
	- Secure configurations
	- Application whitelisting/blacklisting
- Antivirus:
	- Can do the following actions:
		- Block
			- Get out of here
		- Allow
			- You're good
		- Clean
			- Delete the bad parts
		- Delete
			- Delete everything
		- Quarantine
			- Move to a sandbox
- Penetration testing!
	- My love, my precious!
	- Process:
		- Enumeration
		- Scan for vulnerabilities
		- Exploit
		- Prepare and apply corrective measures (optional)
		- Other vectors: social engineering, physical security, etc. (optional)
	- Tools:
		- Nmap
		- Nessus
		- Metasploit (`msfvenom`, `msfconsole`, etc.)
		- BurpSuite
		- etc.
- Nessus
	- Vulnerability scanner, used by many professionals.
	- It can even have agent-based stuff by putting software on the machine.
	- Very good, industry standard.
- Nmap vs. Nessus
	- Nmap is a port scanner!
	- Nessus is a vulnerability scanner!
- Metasploit:
	- Open source framework tool, takes your CVEs and gives you known exploits.
	- Script kiddy behavior.
- Common OS attacks/tools:
	- Zero-day (undiscovered vulnerability)
	- Malware (software that is not nice to you)
	- Ransomware (give me money or I delete your files)
	- Trojan horse (look friendly, not friendly)
	- Buffer overflow (your end base pointer is mine)
	- Spyware (let me see all your secrets such that I may sell them)
	- Adware (look at these ads and give me money)
	- Worm (duplicate and spread throughout the network)

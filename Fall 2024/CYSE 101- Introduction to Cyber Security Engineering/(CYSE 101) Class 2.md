Please tell me that I can go through at an accelerated pace...

### History of Modern Computing
- First machines - late 60s
- Email was in the early 70s, with PCs coming out shortly after
- Encryption was invented in 1976
- First viruses were made in 1985
- Firewalls were developed from 1988 to 1990
- DDoS attacks were done in 2000
- Stuxnet was created in 2010, a shift of cybersecurity being used for espionage
- Ransomware was created in 2013, showing a shift to financial gain

### First Cyber Crime and Attacks 
- First official attack was from Allen Scherr against an MIT database of passwords
- Ian Murphy was the first person convicted of cyber crime
- In 1995, Vladimir Levin hacked Citibank, transferring more than 10 million dollars.
- Post 2010, cyber attacks explode with data leaks, Stuxnet, and sophisticated attacks

### Modern Day
- Colonial Pipeline
	- Ransomware attack from DarkSide (Russian group) in May of 2021
	- Colonial Pipeline controls 45% of oil on the East Coast
	- State Emergency in 17 states paid a ransom of $4.4 million in Bitcoin 
- SolarWinds
	- Supply Chain attack discovered in December 2020 by APT29 (Cozy Bear, also Russian)
	- Compromised SolarWinds' Orion platform
- Nation-States/Cyber Warfare
	- Governments use Nation-States to disrupt, damage, or control information
	- Largest nation-state actors come from the US, Israel, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea
- AI Attacks
	- Automate and enhance cyber attacks
- Deepfakes
	- More phishing/fraud
- Securing IoT Devises
	- IoT devices are lever secure :)
- Quantum Computing
	- Crack encryption with Shor's algorithm

### What is cyber security
- Official definition:
	- The practice of defending computers, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as IT security or electronic information security
- Things to come in this class
	- What are the cyber components of a system?
	- What are the threats and vulnerabilities of that system?
	- How do we reduce the risk by design through security?

### General case study format
- What happened
- What vulnerabilities were exploited
- By what/whom and how
- What was the loss/damage/cost
- How could the event have been avoided
- What aspect of security (C, I, A) was violated
- What vulnerabilities are/were present
	- Sophistication
- What threats are/were present
	- Who and why
- What could be done to mitigate the risk or damage
	- Controls or countermeasures

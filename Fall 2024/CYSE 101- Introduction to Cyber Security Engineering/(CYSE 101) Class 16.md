### I am bored.
- If I need to write a peer review for one more presentation I am going to shove a railroad spike through my cranium.
- Railroad spike time!

### Human factors
- We are the last line of defense, but also considered the weakest link.
- Anthem attack:
	- Anthem was an insurance company that was hacked.
	- Our general cycle:
		- Phishing attack
		- Password stealing Trojan
		- Lookalike websites
		- Database access
		- Data exfiltration
- Equifax attack:
	- Same thing, started with a phishing attack.
- A bunch:
	- Uber: credentials stored on private GitHub
	- Anthem: phishing
	- Target: phishing (HVAC contractor)
	- Carbanak: phishing
	- CFTC: phishing
	- RSA: phishing
- Verizon breach report:
	- Phishing represents 98% of social incidents and 93% of breaches. Email continues to be the most common vector (96%).
	- Nation states are like 70% of attacks.
- Social engineering:
	- "Any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in their best interest."
	- Goal:
		- Get the person to provide information or access that you should not be given to.
- Inspiration:
	- Trojan horse
	- Victor Lustig (guy sold the Eiffel Tower)
	- Charles Ponzi - Ponzi Scheme
	- Any other person or event in history which took advantage of people through their:
		- Curiosity
		- Fear
		- Trust
		- The desire to help
		- The desire to comply
	- Based.
- Social engineering lifecycle:
	- Investigation: preparing the ground for the attack (OSINT)
	- Hook: deceiving the victim(s) to get a foothold
	- Play: Obtaining information over a period of time
	- Exit: closing the interaction, ideally without arousing suspicion
- Social engineering techniques:
	- Physical location
	- Phone
	- Trashing (dumpster dive)
	- Mail theft
	- Social networking
	- Email
	- Shoulder surfing
	- Texting
- Phishing:
	- Email or other communication masquerading as legitimate content or sites.
	- Types:
		- Typical phishing: shotgun, mass targets
		- Spear phishing: single target
		- Clone phishing: copy of legitimate message
		- Whaling: target top executives
	- Link shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl.com, tiny.cc)
- Why is phishing so effective:
	- People receive hundreds of emails every day
	- People get curious
	- What to do
		- Constant monitoring of incoming phishing emails
		- Email filtering
		- Firewalls
		- Security awareness training - the human element!
- Insider threats:
	- Malicious:
		- Conscious decision to act inappropriately
		- Motive to harm
	 - Accidental:
		 - No conscious decision to act inappropriately
		 - No motive to harm
		 - Just made a mistake
		 - Still a threat from the security standpoint.
	 - Negligent:
		 - No motive to harm, but also no motive to protect.
 - Dealing with insider threats:
	 - A malicious insider is defined as a current or former employee, contractor, or business partner who meets the following criteria:
		 - Has or had authorized access to an organization's network, system, or data
		 - ...
	- Insiders can be stopped, but it is a complex problem.
- Insider threat responsibility:
	- HR
	- Legal
	- Physical security
	- Data owners
	- IT
	- Software engineering
- Defense against social engineering:
	- Functional level: security policy
	- Paramater level: security awareness training for everyone
	- Fortress level: resistance training for key employees
	- Gotcha level: social engineering land mines
	- Offensive level: incident response

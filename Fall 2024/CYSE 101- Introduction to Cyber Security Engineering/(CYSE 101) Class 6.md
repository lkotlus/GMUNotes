### Auditing and Accountability
- Accountability
	- Every individual who works with an IT system should have specific responsibilities for information assurance.
	- Everyone is responsible for the security of information.
- Auditing
	- Review of what you did, test systems, collect information, etc.
	- Consists of:
		- Permissions
		- Usage
		- Log review, monitoring, assessments, inventory, etc.
	- How well was accountability done?
- Up to this point...
	- Identification (who are you)
	- Verification (verify who you are)
	- Authentication (prove who you are)
	- Authorization (what you can do)
	- Access control (enforce what you can do)
	- Accountability (what you did)
		- Trace actions to users
		- Logging
		- Nonrepudiation (can't deny anything)
		- Deterrent (someone/something is watching the system)
	- Auditing (review what you did)
- Vulnerability Assessment:
	- Scan for vulnerabilities and weakness in systems and users
	- Enumerate systems
	- Report on vulnerabilities including CVEs, criticality score, and priority of patching
- Pen test:
	- Exploit the vulnerabilities found from the vulnerability assessment
- Building accountability
	- Patching, cred management, zero trust, and least priv
	- Automate repetitive IT stuff
	- NIST Roadmaps for structuring security and Center for Internet Security Best Practices type things.
	- Identify security champions (who isn't an idiot) within the org!
		- Reward good behavior
- RACI
	- Responsible
		- Assigned to do work
		- At least one person must be assigned
		- "The doer"
	- Accountable
		- Authority to assign/delegate work to R's
		- Answerable for completion of work
		- Usually one person
	- Consulted
		- Consulted before the work is done
		- Usually an expert
	- Informed
		- Told about the work results
- What is a cyber security audit
	- Comprehensive analysis and review of IT infrastructure
	- Detects vulnerabilities and threats
	- Displays weak links and high-risk practices
	- Primary method for examining compliance
	- Designed to evaluate something against a specific standard to validate that exact needs are met
- Audit scope
	- Data security (network access control, encryption, security at rest, transmission, etc.)
	- Operational security (security policies, procedures, etc.)
	- Network security (network and security controls, anti virus, SOC, etc.)
	- System security (hardening process, patching, priv account management, role-based access, etc.)
	- Physical security (disk encryption, role-based access, biometric data, MFA, social engineering, etc.)
- Best practices
	- Define the scope of your audit
	- Share the Resource Auditors Need
	- Audit relevant compliance standards
	- Detail your network structure
	- Detect and record risks and vulns
	- Access existing cyber risk management performance
	- Prioritize risk response
	- Ensure regular audits

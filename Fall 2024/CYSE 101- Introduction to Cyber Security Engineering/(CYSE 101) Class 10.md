### Network security
- Networking is the way computers and machines communicate with each other.
- How it works:
	- Networks follow protocols, which define how communications are sent and received. 
	- Example: IP, TCP, UDP, ...
- Architecture:
	- Machine -> router -> cell towers -> receiving router -> facilitated to the machine you are communicating to
- OSI Model:
	- Application
	- Presentation
	- Session
	- Transport
	- Network
	- Data Link
	- Physical
- Internet Protocol (IP)
	- Protocol used for defining addressing and routing of devices
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
	- Protocol used to send network errors and other important messages
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
	- Connectionless protocol that establishes communication between devices
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
	- Establishes communication between devices using the TCP Handshake
		- SYN: client sends
		- SYN_ACK: server acknowledges
		- ACK: client acknowledges acknowledgement
		- Data packet(s)
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
	- Provides privacy, authentication, and integrity (SSL) and enables encryption of network traffic (TLS) respectively
- Ports!
	- Different services go on different ports.
	- Prof said to memorize.
	- Common ports:
		- 20/21: FTP
		- 22: SSH
		- 23: Telnet
		- 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
		- 53: DNS
		- 80: HTTP
		- 110: Post Office Protocol (POP3)
		- 143: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
		- 161: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
		- 443: HTTPS
		- 3389: RDP
- Network segmentation:
	- We want to split up parts of our network so people don't have access to everything. Person gets into the HR segment, they can't see the finance part.
- Firewall:
	- What do we allow in and out? Rules!
	- We do it based on inbound/outbound and on ports.
	- Firewall types:
		- Stateless: 
			- Looks at header data based on static rules
		- Stateful:
			- Aware of the state of the network, filters based on header data, rules, and context (typically uses some machine learning or something similar).
			- Example: if a packet hasn't been seen entering the network before, we will look at it a bit more deeply.
		- Application Firewall:
			- Deep packet inspection, looks at the header, payload, and context to make permit/deny decisions. May use AI or adaptive techniques.
	- Firewalls do three actions:
		- Accept (allow packet to enter)
		- Drop (just act like nothing happened)
		- Reject (drop + block)
	- Firewalls can be configured to have rules from the following 2 approaches:
		- Blacklist (default-allow/implicit-allow)
			- All packets are allowed except those which are defined to be in the blacklist
		- Whitelist (default-deny/implicit-deny)
			- All packets are dropped or rejected by default unless implicitly defined in the whitelist
- Proxy servers:
	- Used for some baby protection
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems:
	- Detection (ALERT)
		- Read and analyze network apckets in comparison to a database of known threats or baseline activity.
		- An IDS will detect and alert on potential threats
		- NIDS: Network Intrusion Detection System
		- HIDS: Host Intrusion Detection System
	- Intrusion Prevention System (BLOCK)
		- An IPS will block a potential threat
		- NIPS: Network Intrusion Prevention System
		- HIPS: Host Intrusion Prevention System
	- Signature Based (Compares incoming packets to known signatures)
	- Behavior Based (looks for unusual behavior of malware and threat activity (like disabling antivirus))
	- False Positive (label safe activity malicious)
	- False Negative (not finding malicious activity)
- Defensive network security philosophy:
	- Protect
		- Firewalls, IPS, AV, email filters, etc.
	- Detect
		- IDS, file integrity checking, etc.
	- React:
		- Triage, reconfiguration, backups, snapshots, forensics, etc.
- Tools:
	- Data-Loss Prevention (DLP)
		- USB blocking
		- Cloud based
		- Email
	- Mail gateway
		- Spam filter
		- DLP
		- Encryption
	- Wireshark
		- Get packets
- Zones/Topologies:
	- DMZ
	- Extranet
	- Intranet
	- Wireless
	- Guest
	- NAT
- Honeypots!
- VPNs!
- Common networking attacks:
	- Man in the Middle (MITM)
	- Password cracking
	- Replay
	- Evil twin
	- Rogue AP
	- Jamming
- Web:
	- Surface: google results
	- Deep: can reach, not shown on google
	- Dark: TOR required
		- Three nodes you travel to before your destination
		- Encrypt at each node

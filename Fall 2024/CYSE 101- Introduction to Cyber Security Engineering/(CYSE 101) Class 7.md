### Cryptography!
- So this falls under Cryptology (study of creating and solving codes)
- Breaking would by cryptanalysis.
- Making would be cryptography. Under this, we have encryption and decryption.
- A key is an
	- Algorithm, device, or hint which has the ability to encrypt and decrypt data.
- A cipher is a secret way of writing and delivering messages. Commonly used from Rome and Egypt all the way up to WWII.
- A transposition cipher scrambles the position of characters into another word, which is defined by the key.
- A Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher which shifts letters by a certain amount.
- The issue with this is that the key is still plain text.
- Enigma! This was pretty epic.
- Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography
	- Symmetric:
		- One key for encryption and decryption
		- Key is secretly exchanged and agreed upon
		- Once the private key is established, messages will be encrypted and decrypted with that key.
		- Symmetric Cryptography algorithms to know: AES, DES, 3DES, RC4
	- Asymmetric Cryptography:
		- Uses two keys (public and private)
		- Messages are encrypted with the public key
		- Only decrypted using the private key.
		- Stolen messages can't really be decrypted easily.
		- Asymmetric algorithms to know: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman, ECC
	- Cool
- Use cases:
	- Symmetric:
		- Faster, still secure, but relies on secure transmission of the key.
		- Encrypt files at rest
		- Encrypting large amounts of data
		- Secure internal communications in a trusted network
		- Wi-Fi Encryption
	- Asymmetric:
		- Slower, but more secure
		- Secure communications over the internet
		- Email encryption
		- Digital signatures
		- Key exchange
		- Cryptocurrency/blockchain
- Cryptography terms:
	- Stream vs. Block Ciphers:
		- Stream Cipher - Encryption technique which transforms plain text to code byte by byte
		- Block Cipher - Encryption technique which transforms plain text to code in blocks of X number of bytes at a time
	- Data-in-transit vs. Data-at-rest vs. Data-in-use
		- Data-in-transit: data actively being sent back and forth between two hosts
		- Data-at-rest: data sitting on my machine
		- Data-in-use: data which is sitting on my machine but being used locally
	- Security through obscurity:
		- Concept in cybersecurity which states that a system can remain secure if the secrets are hidden. This is invalid, and why we use cryptography.
- Hashes:
	- Converting data into fixed-length strings of letters and numbers.
	- One-way function, irreversible, completely random.
	- Each input is unique to each to each output, changing one character in an input will drastically change the output.
	- Let's us ensure that data isn't intercepted, detect changes in data, and keep data private.
	- Popular algorithms:
		- MD5
		- SHA1
		- SHA256
		- MD5-Crypt
	- We can try to break hashes with rainbow tables, but this frequently requires a salt.
- Digital signatures:
	- Algorithm used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message.
	- "Nobody messed with this."
	- Sender hashes the message and encrypts the hash.
	- Receiver decrypts the message and hash.
	- Receiver hashes the decrypted message, if the message wasn't changed then the hashes will match.
	- This ensures non-repudiation, sufficient evidence exists that nobody can deny any action
- Cryptographic attacks:
	- Side-channel attacks
		- Use physical data to break a cryptosystem such as monitoring CPU cycles or power consumption used while data is being encrypted or decrypted
	- Rainbow table attack
		- Cracking a password based off the hash referenced to a table of already known hashes. This database is referred to as a rainbow table.
- SSH!
	- Secure Shell! (my love)
	- Encrypts all data because it is secure.
	- Much better than telnet. Telnet sucks balls.
	- Client-server model to serve you shell access to a server. Operates on TCP port 22 (by default) and listens for incoming connections. Upon a connection, we can do our cool stuff remotely.
- Steganography:
	- Security through obscurity.
	- Hide data within an ordinary file to avoid detection. Typically images.

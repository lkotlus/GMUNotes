### Final review
- Network security
	- Networking is how devices communicate with each other.
	- Network security is securing communications to protect CIA of messages.
	- Network segmentation is just splitting the network up.
	- Firewalls filter things:
		- Accept, drop, reject
		- Policies can be whitelists or blacklists
		- Different firewall types:
			- Stateless: inspect headers, blocks by IP
			- Stateful: inspect session and headers, stateless+context.
			- Application aware: filters by known good or bad applications.
	- Proxy server: middleman between machine and web server that can filter things before giving access to machines.
	- IDS vs. IPS:
		- Intrusion Detection System: detects malicious traffic but does not take action, just notifies
		- Intrusion Prevention System: detects malicious traffic and quarantines/blocks it.
	- IP:
		- Internet protocol!
		- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
		- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
	- Honeypots: look at this zero password controlled SSH port
	- VPN:
		- Virtual private network.
		- Remote access: used mostly for remote workers who want to remotely access corporate resources without going through the open internet. 
		- Site-to-site: a method of routing traffic through designated servers.
	- Surface web, deep web, dark web:
		- Surface: Google results
		- Deep: available normally but doesn't show up in a search engine
		- Dark: You need TOR.
	- TOR:
		- Complete anonymity through random network hops and additional layers of encryption.
- OS Security:
	- Operating system: software that runs on a machine holding lots of little processes
	- Port scanning, important ports:
		- 443: HTTPS
		- 80: HTTP
		- 22: SSH
		- 21: telnet
		- 53: DNS
		- 3389: RDP
	- Antivirus:
		- Signature-based: has a database of known malicious programs and if a piece of software matches that, it is deemed malicious
		- Behavior-based: more intelligent, recognizes typical malicious behavior
		- Reputation-based: trusts software that is already on other machines in the network, if not, it is suspicious
		- AV takes the following actions:
			- Block/allow
			- Clean/delete/quarantine
			- Share or not
		- Nmap: port scanner
		- Nessus: vulnerability scanner
- Application security:
	- Buffer overflow:
		- Idiot didn't know how arrays work in C.
	- SQL Injection:
		- Idiot didn't clean input
	- XSS:
		- Idiot didn't clean input
	- XSRF:
		- Threat actor can insert malicious code into a public website that can redirect end users to a malicious website of the hackers choosing. Attack on the end user.
	- Fuzzing:
		- Test if your website is vulnerable by feeding a bunch of random payloads.
- Mobile/IoT security:
	- Doesn't exist lmao.
	- Mobile devices:
		- Roaming devices with an OS
	- IoT devices:
		- Internet connected devices taht don't run a full OS
	- Common issues with these types of devices:
		- Mobile OS
		- Jailbreaking
		- Malicious apps
		- Lack of updates
		- Upgrading
		- Additional security
		- Lack of transparency and regulation
	- Two important views of IoT security:
		- Inward security: harm that can be done within a compromised IoT device
		- Outward security: harm that can be done to other machines connected to the same network as an IoT device
	- The bigger picture:
		- The number one concern with these types of devices is protecting data
		- The way to do it is through increased regulation enforcing best practices
- Compliance:
	- This topic is about claws and regulations as it relates to data privacy of users and protecting PII
	- Personally Identifiable Information (PII): any information which on its own or with other information can be used to identify, contact, or locate a single person.
	- PII breach laws:
		- California S.B 1386: must report the unauthorized release of personal information of a California Resident
		- All 50 states have similar laws
	- General Data Protection and Regulation (GDPR): set of laws which governs the way that organizations must use, process, and store personal data. 
	- Safe Harbor: 
		- Specifies that certain conduct will be okay. For example, a company will not be required to notify users of a breach if the data is encrypted. 
		- This serves as an enticement to do the right thing and encrypt all data.
- Operations security:
	- Focus on protecting the most important and valuable assets first.
	- Process:
		1. Identify critical information
		2. Analyze threats
		3. Analyze vulnerabilities
		4. Asses risk
		5. Apply countermeasures
	- Risk control strategies:
		- Avoidance
			- Prevent exploitation
			- Example: patch
		- Mitigation:
			- Reduce impact
			- Example: restrict access
		- Transference:
			- Shift risk to someone else
			- Example: cyber insurance
		- Acceptance:
			- Do nothing
	- $\text{Risk}=P(E|V,T)\cdot\text{Impact}$
- Physical security:
	- Some of the physical security threats include, but are not limited to, fires, gasses, liquids, people, etc.
	- Priorities in this exact order: people, data, systems
	- Cold, warm, hot site
		- Cold: empty space
		- Warm: some hardware and partial/old data
		- Hot: exact duplicate of the production site
	- Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID):
		- 0: equally split across disks
		- 1: all data copied across disks
		- 10: mirroring and striping
		- 5: parity, if one disk fails, can recover some from another disk
		- 6: does the same as 5 but can recover from 2 disk failures
	- Some physical security controls include, but are not limited to, fences, gates, lights, CCTV, etc.
		- Prevent: keep the wrong people from coming in
		- Detect: monitor the wrong people coming in
		- Deter: keep the wrong people from wanting to come in
	- Residual data: data that is left over after deleted or when a machine is "destroyed"
- Human element security:
	- Humans are the weakest link
	- Social engineering:
		- Phishing:
			- Message (typically email)
			- Spear (single target)
			- Clone (copy of a legit message)
			- Whaling (target an exec)
		- Solution is training
	- Insider threat:
		- A current or former employee who has or had authorized access and intentionally or unintentionally negatively affects CIA
		- Solution: principle of least privilege
	- Who's responsible? Everyone, but ultimately CYSE majors.
- Assessing security:
	- Conducting security risk assessments can help in identifying if certain security controls are worth it and what actions can be taken to reduce overall risk.
	- Actions taken to help identify this:
		- Vulnerability analysis
		- Penetration tests:
			- Black hat (no good)
			- White hat (good)
			- Grey hat (in the middle)
			- Black box pentest (no knowledge)
			- White box (a lot of information)
			- Grey box (a bit of information)
	- Risk formulas:
		- Total risk: $\text{Asset Value (AV)}\cdot\text{Threats}\cdot\text{Vulnerabilities}$
		- Single loss expectancy (SLE): $\text{Asset Value}\cdot\text{Exposure Factor (EF)}$
		- Annual loss expectancy (ALE): $\text{SLE}\cdot\text{Annualized Rate of Occurence (ARO)}$
		- Return on investment (ROI): $\text{ALE (before safeguard)}-\text{ALE (after safeguard)}-\text{annual cost of safeguard}$

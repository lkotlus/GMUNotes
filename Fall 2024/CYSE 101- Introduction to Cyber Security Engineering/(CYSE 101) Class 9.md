### Midterm review!
- Know about the Lodz Tram attack
	- Kid was able to derail a train with a remote.
	- Integrity and availability
	- Lack of authentication
	- Unknown threat actor, probably a script kiddie
	- Authentication and physical security would be good additions to make it safe
- Know about the Mirai botnet
	- Threat actors created an IoT botnet and deliver a DDoS attack with infected devices.
	- Availability (DDoS)
	- Firewall/network filtering and lack of DDoS security were present
	- Script kiddie created the threat, anyone could have performed it
	- Firewall and network filtering would be good, also enabling IPS or IDS. 
- Linux command line!
	- Remember how `chmod` works, but you already know that because you're a gimungus nerd.
- Virtual machines!
	- Hypervisor and layering
- Fundamentals
	- CIA (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
	- Vulnerability (flaw/weakness in system)
	- Threat (Person or thing acting against a system)
	- Risk (Existence of both a threat and vulnerability)
	- Controls (Things done to combat vulnerabilities and deter threats to reduce our risk.)
		- Risk = Vulnerability \* threat \* impact
	- Countermeasures:
		- Protect, detect, or react 
		- Physical (hire guards), logical/technical (encryption), or administrative (mandatory phishing training)
	- Common Cyber Threats
		- APT's (advanced persistent threat), nation state (all nation states are APT's, not all APT's are nation states), social engineering, phishing, ransomware, DDoS
- Identification and authentication:
	- Distinguish between:
		- Identification (associate an identity with a subject, make a claim)
		- Verification (confirm who you are, have a token)
		- Authentication (validating that you are who you say, process the token)
		- Authorization (associating rights/capabilities with a subject, get privs)
	- Factors: 
		- Something you know (pin/password)
		- Something you have (key/card)
		- Something you are (fingerprint/face)
		- MFA (two or more of these factors)
	- Identification methods:
		- 4-digit password: $4^{10}$ possible passwords, 10-digit password with lowercase and numbers: $10^{36}$ different possibilities. $n^m$ where $n$ is the digits and $m$ is the length of the character set.
		- Dumpster diving/shoulder surfing as attacks
		- Biometrics are something you are and are considered the strongest form of authentication
	- Biometrics:
		- FAR (false acceptance rate)
		- FRR (false rejection rate)
- Authorization and access control:
	- Authorization (what you are allowed to do)
	- Access control (what the system enforces you to do)
	- Defense-in-depth
		- Implementing security controls on all layers (policy, physical, network, computer, application, and device)
	- Principal of least privilege (you can only do what you must)
	- Subjects and objects
		- Subject (the thing/people who receive access)
		- Object (the thing subjects receive access to)
	- **Security Models (IMPORTANT)**
		- BLP (Bell-LaPadula):
			- Used to maintain confidentiality
			- Subjects and objects are organized in a non-discretionary fashion with respect to different players of secrecy.
			- Simple confidentiality (NO READ-UP)
			- Star confidentiality (NO WRITE-DOWN)
			- Strong star confidentiality (NO READ WRITE UP DOWN)
		- Biba:
			- Used to maintain integrity
			- Works opposite of BLP
			- Simple integrity (NO READ-DOWN)
			- Star integrity (NO WRITE-UP)
			- Strong star integrity (NO READ WRITE UP DOWN)
	- **Access control models (IMPORTANT)**
		- DAC (discretionary access control): owner decides access
		- MAC (mandatory access control): label based, most strict of all 5, common in government and military settings
		- RBAC (role based access control): based off a user's role (department, location, seniority, work duties, etc.)
		- Rule Based Access Control: based on rules (access between 9 AM and 5 PM only)
		- ABAC (attribute based access control): based off certain attributes of users (roles, tasks), the resource (critical, public), or the environment (night, morning)
	- Access control
		- Access control matrix is a matrix containing permissions which are associated between subjects and objects. Understand and interpret this.
		- Privilege separation: two groups or users don't overlap in permissions/cause a conflict of interest
		- ACL: break down the matrix and represent a single object and what permissions the subjects have for the object. (`rw-r-x-w-`)
		- ACL file permissions:
			- Read: 4, write: 2, execute: 1, nothing: 0
			- We go owner, group, everyone for our digits
			- Just do binary conversions lmao
- Auditing and accountability:
	- Accountability: what you did and deterrent
	- Auditing: reviewing what was actually done
	- Who's accountable? Everyone, but each person has a specific role to play.
- Vulnerability assessment vs pen test (pen test has real exploitation, vulnerability assessment is just scanning)
- RACI
	- Responsible: person assigned
	- Accountable: person with authority to delegate work, people go to this one for answers
	- Consulted: person must be consulted before work is started, must give their blessing
	- Informed: The person just wants to be kept in the loop on what's happening
- Cyber security audit 
	- Analysis of all IT systems, processes, etc. and will usually include a vulnerability assessment and/or pen test.
	- Scope will typically include: data security, operational security, network security, system security, and physical security.
- Cryptography:
	- Cryptology (study of codes)
	- Cryptanalysis (study of breaking codes)
	- Cryptography (study of making codes)
	- Encryption (plaintext to ciphertext)
	- Decryption (ciphertext to plaintext)
- Symmetric vs. Asymmetric key cryptography
	- Asymmetric (public key cryptography) is two keys. Public key encrypts, private key decrypts. (more secure, slower)
	- Symmetric: 1 shared key exchanged through a secure channel or method such as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. (less secure, faster)
- Hashes and digital signatures
	- One-way operation to a fixed-length result.
	- Make sure we don't have collisions!
	- Digital signature is making sure that the file hasn't been changed by checking if the stated hash of something that has been sent matches the true hash.
		- I send you an encrypted hash
		- You decrypt the hash
		- You compare the hash of the message I sent with the decrypted hash.
		- If they match, we're good. Otherwise, the data has been tampered with.
- Ciphers:
	- Substitution ($\text{ROT}n$ means rotate by $n$)
	- Transposition (plaintext is repositioned but letters are unchanged )
	- Other important ciphers are Vigenere, ADFGVX, base64.
	- Don't need to know how to break/make, just know how they work.
- SHA Suite:
	- SHA1 (160-bit hash)
	- SHA-256 (256-bit hash)
	- SHA-512 (512-bit hash)
- SSH and Side Channel Attacks
	- Secure shell. Encrypted port 22 remote entry thing. Very epic, favorite protocol.
	- Side channel attacks: use physical data of the computer such as CPU cycles to get an idea of how data is being encrypted or decrypted. For example, if a hacker sees users CPU decrypting messages consistently at 0.001s, they might figure out what algorithm is being used.

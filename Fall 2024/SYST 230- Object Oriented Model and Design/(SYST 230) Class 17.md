### Simulations in MagicDraw (I think)
- This should be incredibly boring. I can't wait.
- Items of definition:
	- Blocks (not instances!)
- Usages:
	- Definitions with relationships
- Parametric diagram:
	- Captures relationships between blocks.
	- Example: the weight of your ATM is the sum of the weight of each part.
	- This is a specialized version of the Internal Block Diagram (IBD).
- We can build parametric diagrams with constraint blocks. This is done automatically by mapping normal block parts, which is really cool.
- Results from parametric diagrams are involved within simulations!
- We can add requirements to our diagram! You did a requirements decomposition for 205.
	- Satisfy relationships are used to show that a certain value, part, etc. satisfies a requirement.
- We can put matlab code into our diagrams.

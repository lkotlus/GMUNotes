First class at GMU as a full-time student. Exciting.

### Learning outcomes
- Deep understanding of Python built-in types and object oriented concepts.
- Working knowledge of useful Python libs.
- Development skills with SysML/UML diagrams for documentation and design modeling.
- Hands-on experience with design software for implementation and analysis of system architectures (buzzword central up in the syllabus).

### Quizzes and Midterms
- Usually on Wednesdays 
- Quizzes last 30 mins
- Midterm is the whole class
- No make ups

### This class
- Not a programming course
- We will be learning...
	- OO concepts in Python
	- Solving problems using python
		- Scientific computing
		- Data visualization and analysis
	- Learning design and modeling techniques using object-orientation

### Common student complaints
- "I'm not going to convince you that this course is important" (I love this guy)
- The reason we have this course is that object oriented notation is important to understand. Cyber Security Engineers need to understand the full context of a system they intend to exploit. Based.

### Software
- Professor uses anaconda for specific tools and whatnot for scientific computing. 
- Anaconda sounds like bloatware, not on my Linux machine!
- I get to keep using my own IDE. Neovim on VSCode survives another day.
- JupyterLab/JupyterNotebook can be useful.
- We're using [pep-0008](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008) as our style guide.

### Grading
- Assignments (30%)
- Quizzes (15%)
- Recitation Activities (lab, 20% of grade)
- Midterm (20% of grade)
- Final (15% of grade)
- **90-93 is an A-**
- "Asking me for your grade is like asking me to solve for you a very simple arithmetic problem."

### Recitation
- The lab section is recitation.
- We should be writing some code (or at least it seems like that).
- If I want to skip recitation, I cannot. I can ask to just solve the problems as fast as I can and then leave.
- Recitation is for helping students with working through the problems.
- "Even if in this class there is something that you think you already know, let me know and we will find some solution." (I love this guy)

### Office hours
- TA is not yet known, but there will be office hours with the TA.
- Office hours with the prof are Mondays and Wednesdays from 3 to 4 or by appointment. Online is available upon request.
- Go to the TA, if they don't solve the issue, go to the professor.

### Weekly Modules
- Most important tab in blackboard.
- Work will be given in JupyterNotebook. I can also just go to [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.cloud) to do it online instead. I should also be able to do things in VSCode.
- There should be some extension that I can add to VSCode to do all of the stuff.

### Python built-in data types
- Fairly certain that we have no primitives (everything is an object because we just absolutely *must* use encapsulation and abstraction on everything everywhere all the time).
- "And therefore, Python is not a very good language." (I love this guy)

- UML has a suite of diagrams that cover the entire process of everything you need to do. Requirements, design, programming, and testing.
- Previous stages are good to still have for documentation, especially when changes need to be made.
- Structural diagrams and behavior diagrams fr.
- Without arrows, aggregation/composition are bidirectional
	- Side with the diamond aggregates/is composed of the other class, and the class on the other side has an association with the other.
- With an arrow, it's just the one direction.
- Next time we will do use case diagrams and execute them.

### Use case diagrams
- This class is turning into a MagicDraw tutorial. Cringe.
- Use case diagrams can be used to generate activity diagrams!
- We can include use cases in use cases (sort of like a function).
- Next week we're switching to SysML!
	- Maybe we will end up *writing* things instead of dragging and dropping random crap. 
	- I don't want to drag and drop anymore.

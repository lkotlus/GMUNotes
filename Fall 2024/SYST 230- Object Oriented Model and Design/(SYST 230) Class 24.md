### Final
- So I don't need to take the final because he will allow us to just keep our projected grades. This is amazing.

### Class
- I'm honestly not sure why I'm even here. There is no incentive for me to stay seeing as I already have a good enough grade to keep an A.
- I can't just walk out, that would be rude.
- I'll just learn for the love of learning, I suppose.
- So check this scenario:
	- You have a gimungus system. Hugantic.
	- You don't want your activity diagram to be a complete monster, so how do we go about splitting it up into different ones?
	- This is the topic of the day.
- "Someone's computer is complaining about this application... very loudly."
- "If you were all systems engineering students I would force you to collaborate, but you're cyber security students and you just like to sit in dark rooms for some reason."
- So we can have ports on blocks. Ports allow us to transfer things between blocks. Neat. (They're actually called `<<proxy>>` ports)
- We can send `<<signal>>` nodes between ports.
	- How do we know which port the `<<signal>>` uses? Simple! Just use an internal block diagram!
- With this we can make specifications within particular blocks. We're specifically working on our ports for this one.
- These are very similar to parametric diagrams. Parametric diagrams are special cases of internal block diagrams. In an inheritance diagram, parametric diagrams are a child if internal block diagrams.

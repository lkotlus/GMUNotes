## We might actually get to do object oriented programming in our object oriented programming class today. Wow.
- Core principles
	- Encapsulation
		- Bundle attributes and methods into a class. Also data hiding.
	- Abstraction
		- You don't need to know how it gets done, it just gets done.
	- Inheritance
		- Reusability in our code! Derive your classes.
	- Polymorphism
		- Method overriding (I think).
- Discord notification noise went off during class, they all know that I'm a degenerate now.
- Millennial leftists who have never lived a day under threat of nuclear fire can now reflect upon their graphical user interfaces. Does my `python3` shell hurt your safe space? Does it offend the patrons of your $18 coffee shop? Lectures need to be in "JupyterNotebook" so people can "follow along". Shaking my head right now. Open your terminal, go into a shell, write code like a real man. 
- The professor just wrote an if statement with the following syntax: `if lst is none`. I long for death.
- "Photographs"

## Classes and Objects
- An object is an instance of a class
- Encapsulation
	- Everything you need for a class is in the class
- Abstraction
	- Getters and setters for whatever you need them for (protect protected data)
- Inheritance
	- I can make a triangle class as a child of my shape class
- Polymorphism
	- We can apply one method to multiple types
- "You don't know it, but you're all doing procedural programming"
	- WRONG!
	- I do good programming, you absolute rapscallion. Never speak to me that way again lest I show you the blade with which I was trained since the age of 2.

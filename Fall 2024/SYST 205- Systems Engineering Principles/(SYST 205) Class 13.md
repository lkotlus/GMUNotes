### Last class
- This is the least sad final class. I cannot wait to be done with this. If it's so bad that I don't even like it, then it's safe to assume that literally nobody likes it.
- At any rate, we get to do review for the final with any questions we want. 

### Final review
- My questions:
	- Elaborate on offered vs. acquired systems, especially the tailored suit example.
		- The tailor gives you a special product that is fit specific to you. That suit fits you and (mostly) only you.
		- "Can anyone buy the thing that you just ordered."
	- Can we consider any system that involves "components" that are standalone systems to be an SoS, given that together the exhibit behavior not seen within themselves alone?
		- Yes.
	- What do you consider to be the most important step seen within the majority of SDLCs?
		- "In almost everything you do, the first thing you do is most important because it effects everything that you do later."
- Someone asked about the IDEF0 **again**. If I see one more of these diagrams on the board I am going to bash my cranium in with a railroad spike.
	- This goes for every diagram used. I long for the sweet release of death.
- Do not confuse incident and accident:
	- Incidents are failures.
	- Accidents are incidents that actually lead to damage.
	- You cannot recover directly from the accident. You can recover from the incident before reaching an accident.
	- A hazard is just a fault in the system. It is passive, it simply exists.

### I think just review and whatnot today
- Cheating:
	- Maybe don't do it on the final.
- Bro literally yapping about how hard the DMV is fr.

### Final exam
- We don't need to take it in class.
- Last day of class is the ninth, but the final will be open on Wednesday the eleventh, which is rather cringe.
- One part of the exam is timed, the other is project-based.

### Product Systems Engineering
- Covered previously.
- We are required to be ready to manufacture. MRL (manufacturing readiness level) is a measure created by the DoD and is used by many of the world's major companies (and US agencies). It assesses the maturity of manufacturing readiness.
- Just read the class 7 notes.

### Use cases due tonight!
- **Semester projects are practice for the final!!!**
- We got time in class to do stuff, that was nice.
- <u>Go to career services to find internships!</u>
- Special paid internship with cyber security startups!

### State modelling
- Typically used to represent the life cycle of a block.
- Supports event-based behavior (generally asynchronous)
- Event types:
	- Change event: Represents a condition, which is defined by a boolean-valued expression. This expression triggers a transition when changing from true to false (example: turn key in transmission)
	- Time event: Represents the passage of a defined period of time (5 seconds) or an absolute time (10 PM). A transition is initiated when the time value is satisfied.
	- Signal event: Represents receiving a message from an outside source/diagram. Transition is initiated when it is received (obvious).
- **<u>For the assignment:</u>**
	- We only need one diagram!
	- This is conceptually very difficult, make sure that we are smart.
	- None of our models really have an "off" state. We need to find real, valid, states for our system. What are the groupings of functions or actions in which the "state" changes.
	- Remember that we are looking at this from the perspective of someone/something.
	- The only context that the graders have are our previous submissions. <u>We must be consistent with what our systems do and whatnot.</u>
- For real real fr for.

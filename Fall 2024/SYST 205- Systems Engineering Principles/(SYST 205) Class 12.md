### State diagrams
- You still know how to do these. He is very kindly spending an hour and a half discussing them just to make sure.

### Hazards, incidents, and accidents
- Hazards are faults.
	- Things that just exist.
	- Subpar specifications, tolerances, or environments that the system can encounter.
	- Nail on the road, memory unsafe language, worn out ball bearing, fraying cables, etc.
- Incidents are failures.
	- A hazard is encountered, and the system reaches a state that it should not be in.
	- Example: buffer overflows in a C program. This didn't execute malicious code, but it has reached an invalid state.
	- Life is not at risk yet.
- Accidents.
	- The incident becomes an actual loss of life, data, etc.
	- Hacker exploits a buffer overflow.
- Example:
	- Poor password used: hazard
	- Person guesses: failure
	- Person does malicious things after logging in: accident

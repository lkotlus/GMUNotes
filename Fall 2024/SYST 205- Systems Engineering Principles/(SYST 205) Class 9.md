### Use case diagrams!
- We will see similar things within these to functional models. We're just less concerned with inputs turning into outputs.
- For these, we're concerned more with the chronological order of our use cases.
- A use case is seen from the perspective of the user. We are describing what the user expects to see from the system in terms of nominal behavior.
- A use case can be executed as a test case in the system.
- Unlike an activity diagram or a functional composition, use cases are also valid and viable when we're earlier on in the SDLC. These are useful for figuring out "what do I want this to do" type questions.
- Include and extend are the trickiest relationships. Make sure you understand them.
- Every use case has actors (stick figure), which is one of two things:
	- Human interacting with the system. Class of human confined to a role.
	- External system, which in some role interacts with the system.
- Actors are not individual users, they are particular kinds of users. Examples:
	- Bank customer
	- System administrator
	- Help desk tier 1
- Individuals may be represented by more than one role, thus being represented by more than one actor.
- Ovals are actions. Stick figures are actors. Lines show relationships. Arrows are special.
- Use cases capture functional requirements. We can sometimes write use cases for non-functional requirements. They can be attached to a use case.
- Other times, non-functional requirements apply to subsets or all of the use-cases. 
- **<u>We are only focusing on functional requirements for this class.</u>**
- Use case and scenario are synonyms.
- A use case typically describes a core sequence of steps necessary to achieve its goal.
- Never repeat data. If we said it once, that's enough. If I build a model, don't make a model for the same thing. For use cases, we can refer to other use cases as well as linking other models.
	- Sort of like a code library.
- The default flow of the system can be modified through repeated actions in alternative flows.
- The `<<include>>` relationship means you're reusing the steps of a different use case within yours. Essentially, repeat that use case within this one.
	- This simplifies use cases.
	- Arrow points to the thing you include.
	- We must identify common things that lend themselves to include or extend relationships.
	- Think about 20-30 use cases.
- If `<<include>>` is a function call, then `<<extend>>` is a relationship that allows us to modify the behavior of a use case.
	- Rather than a function call, we're doing inheritance!
	- We still never change the language or edit the steps within the base flow with include. 
	- Extend changes the flow, it isn't just an alternate execution.
- To summarize:
	- `<<include>>` is copy paste
	- `<<extend>>` changes the nature 
- Requirements capture organized by use cases:
	- Identify the actors
	- For each actor find out
		- What they need from the system
		- Any other interactions they expect to have with the system
		- Which use cases have what priority for them
- Possible issues with use cases:
	- Interactions spelled out may be too detailed, may needlessly constrain the design.
	- May specify secondary actors that are not essential for fulfilling goal of primary actor.
		- Does borrowing a book have to involve a librarian?
	- Focus on operational nature of system may result in less attention to architecture
	- May miss requirements not naturally associated with actors.
- Now we have in-class discussion.

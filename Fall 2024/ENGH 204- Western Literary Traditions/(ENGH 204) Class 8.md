- I am Islamophobic
- More discussion on Love
	- Difference between Nora and Gurov
		- Gurov didn't communicate or do anything like that
- Characters didn't change before the 1870s.
- "You need to read it about three times to understand it, it is a wonderful piece of writing."
	- If it requires that, is the point properly conveyed?
- Everything is just about living life all the time.

### The Stranger
- I actually liked this one!
- The title is tough
	- L'Etranger. This doesn't really mean stranger. Also a foreigner!
	- Narrator is foreign to the average person!
	- "The Outsider"
- This book made him incredibly famous.
- Existentialism! Ain't no reason for human existence.
- I like this book because it's logically consistent. You are an atheist -> you are an existentialist, nihilist, or a hedonist to remain logically consistent.
- Ecclesiastes mentioned!
- Murder of the arab!
	- This was strange, I really didn't get it.
- "He's a psychopath" doesn't do us any good at all. It's a label to make us not need to think about it.

### <u>No class Thursday!</u>
- Reading for next week is Heart of Darkness
- It's about the Congo and the horrible treatment of the natives by the Germans.
- The main character in the book is the narrator!
- Pay attention to when he is ruminating about the nature of empire.
- This was 1899, so we're going back in time a little to read it.

### Cheri discussion
- This was also back in time a little bit.
- I was dead wrong on what the women all do.
	- They are courtesans. They get set up by wealthy men that they hold prolonged relationships with and live off the gifts given to them.
	- Wait no, I was right! They do invest once they get the money!
- Colette was a courtesan as well. She was also an open lesbian. Married several times. Fascinating woman.
- Love or not?
	- Truman and I agree.

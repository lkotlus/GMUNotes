### Mrs. Dalloway
- A truly useless book, a waste of time to its very core. I do declare of its complete and utter ridiculous nature, speaking out nothing yet insisting upon itself with unwavering egotism.
- Septimus:
	- Lower middle class, from the suburbs
	- Went to working mans college (basically community college)
	- He works for an auctioneer as a clerk (he is very good at it)
	- He has a bright future in sales, except for that he doesn't
- Clarissa understands Septimus' action just as he does. Freedom, escape.
	- Figure this out!

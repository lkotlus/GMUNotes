### Spring awakening
- We start off with realism, but we end with a ghost and a masked man.
- Who was the masked man?
- Fate
	- The way things have to turn out
- There isn't much positive view on religion in the play, so the masked man probably isn't supposed to be a god or any such thing.
- The masked man represents life, he says it himself. "At that very moment you stood between life and death."
- He also, apparently, appeared to Moritz somehow.
- Authors at this period liked to yell to you about life at the end. This came from "life philosophy", which is just a grasping for meaning that isn't nihilism when you don't have any sort of god.

### Woah!
- Narratology! 
	- Study of narrative literature
	- Consists of plot, which is a single course of action with a beginning, middle, and end.
	- Plot leads to...
		- Genre (comedy, tragedy, or romance)
		- Narrator
			- Pre indirect discourse (in the mind of the character from a third person without saying "he thought" or "he realized")
- Literature is usually imaginative fiction that is written down.
- We frequently see literature split into
	- Fiction
	- College/"serious"	
- Masscult/midcult fiction (lots of romance and comedy)
	- "Low brow"
- Plot is going to become more and more difficult to analyze as we will have less action. It fizzles out the more high class we get. Action is not as important as psychology and "the how of saying" in our high brow stuff.
- "Literature" is about how it is said than what is told.
- Compassion is Chekhov's favorite emotion.

### Thomas Mann
- Tonio Kruger man is so pretentious I cannot stand him.
- "I think Tristan is the comic version of Tonio Kruger".
- "Innocence means not being Tonio"
- What the artsy woman thought literature was for: 
- The plot:
	- Beginning: hopeless child
	- Middle: wayward adult
	- End: acceptance (artsy woman was right)
	- Single course of action: Tonio goes around and has a victim complex and is cursed for being so special and intelligent

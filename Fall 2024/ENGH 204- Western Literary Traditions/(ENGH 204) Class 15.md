### More on Mrs. Dalloway
- And whatnot.
- Quiz today was really mean :(
- Inference!
	- We can interpret and misinterpret language in many ways.
	- We are trained to be mind readers in English.
	- We don't get our right answers and wrong answers.
- Bathos: "a dying fall" (rather than building up in a book, you build down)
- James Joyce wrote Ulysses, it's pretty much a spoof of The Odyssey.
- Woolf liked the idea of a whole day and a whole city for a book was a great idea, but she hated Ulysses. 
- Woolf wants to get Ulysses right.
- How do we fit something so massive into something so small?
	- We need a spread of exemplary people, show them all, and get into all of their heads.
	- This is really hard.
- We need their inside/outside actions, their classes, their race, etc.
	- We don't have people of color in this book!
	- But there are people of different classes.
- Woolf takes a class approach rather than a race approach.
	- Clarissa: upper class
	- Peter: middle class
	- Septimus: lower class
- Woolf does sexuality as well!

This man is clinically insane. I am cowering in fear of his manic nature.

### Greats, classic, etc.
- A great book is great because of value.
- A classic is one that transcends time. It remains relevant and resonates with people. More than that, it is worthy of being copied.

### We shall begin in 1890
- England had the largest empire the world had ever seen.
- Everyone was given a Latin textbook teaching the Aeneid.
- This was significant culturally because it was about the founding of the Roman Empire.

### The classics of modernism
- Modern is distinctly tied to an idea that the world has changed.

### What is literature
- Not all books are considered literature
- There is high brow (sophisticated) and low brow (popular)
- Literature is serious and is difficult of access
- Finally we get to the literal definition (non-sociological): literature is the works of the imagination based on works on forms of thought about the limits of human possibility. It makes claims on our affections and the world. It is as much about what it does to us as what it says about the world.

### Why is Kafka so hard?
- Presented as realism, but not realistic!
- Expressionism:
	- We leave realism! They did this at the end of Spring Awakening.
- Surrealism is writing without thinking about it. Surrealism $\ne$ Expressionism.
- Kafka wasn't a surrealist or an expressionist. He was just himself.

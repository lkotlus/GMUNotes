- So I really faked my way through that plot problem in the quiz...
- That's fine, though. I'll take more notes on what he says about random stuff like that. 
- Just so I don't forget again later, **plot teaches us cause and effect**.

- Genre comes from genus. It is the "type of thing". 
	- Romance- didn't get to it
	- Comedy- when we realize the laws were stupid, they didn't matter. Not a law of nature, a silly mistake. Reconciliation by marriage/hug.
	- Tragedy- the innocent suffering (modern), the guilty suffering (classic), laws of nature have been broken (Shakespeare). Reconciliation by death or exile.
- Who was the masked man? The spirit of life.
- Note that slavery in Russia wasn't abolished until the 1870s, they were called serfs, they were white.

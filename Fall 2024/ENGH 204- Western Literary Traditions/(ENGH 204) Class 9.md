### Kafka and Rilke!
- The subject of art and artists is incredibly important for the writers and readers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
- High cult literature is supposed to make you think about yourself or the world in a more sophisticated way.
- Low cult is entertainment.
- Tonio wanted to be high and low cult.

### Hunger Artist
- Theme, "aboutness"
- I found it to be choice and artist vs. society.

### First Sorrow
- Who's sorrow?
	- I think trapeze boy
	- Some think impresario (incorrect)

### Why is Kafka Hard?
- It's outlandish! Things are foreign and strange all the time.
- It seems to be that this thing must mean something, but we **don't get it.**
- What do the mouse folk represent? I have zero clue!
- Crazy situation, follow through it as if it's real life.
- Presented as if it is realist, premise is absurdist.
- The stories are about trying to answer the question without the plot.
- Fables without morals. We are looking constantly for the "aboutness" and the moral.
- Kafka gives us both a little too much and a bit too little.

### Revisions
- What is the primary goal of the SDL?
	- To integrate security activities throughout the SDLC process.
- At which phase of the SDL should threat modeling typically begin?
	- During the requirements/design phase

### Microsoft SDL
- Microsoft has an SDL (it wouldn't seem to be very effective)
- This is an industry-leading software security assurance process.
- Core concepts:
	- Ongoing education and training (certs)
	- Continuous progress and improvement
	- Accountability
- SDL Optimization Model:
	- Based on the maturity model
	- Contains five capabilities areas:
		- Training, policy, and organizational capabilities
		- Requirements and design
		- Implementation
		- Verification
		- Release and response
	- We rate them on the scale:
		- Basic
		- Standardized
		- Advanced
		- Dynamic
	- There's a checklist. We go into a tier based on what is checked off.
- Roles, Responsibilities, and Qualifications
	- Reviewer/Advisory Roles (SME - not part of the project):
		- SME - not part of the project
		- Provide project security and privacy oversight and have the authority to accept or reject security and privacy plans from a team.
	- Team Champions
		- SME - project team
		- Responsible for negotiating, accepting, and tracking minimum security and privacy requirements and maintaining clear lines of communication with advisors and decision-makers during a software development project.
- Overall process:
	- Training (unique from SDLC)
		- Core security training
		- Establish training criteria
		- Establish minimum training frequency
		- Establish minimum acceptable group training thresholds
	- Requirements
		- Opportunity to consider security at the outset of a project
		- Development team identifies lead security and privacy contacts - "Champions"
		- Security Advisor assigned
		- Security Advisor reviews product plan, makes recommendations, and may set additional requirements
		- Mandate the use of bug tracking/job assignment system
		- Define and document security and privacy bug bars
			- A bug bar is a set of criteria that defines the minimum acceptable level of security quality for a project:
				- Critical
				- Important
				- Moderate
				- Low
	- Design
		- Define and document security architecture, identify security-critical components
		- Document attack surface and limit through default settings
		- Define supplemental security ship criteria due to unique product issues
			- XXS tests
			- Deprecation of weak crypto
		- Threat modelling
			- Systematic review of features and product architecture from a security point of view
			- Identify threats and mitigations
	- Implementation
		- Full spectrum review - used to determine processes, documentation, and tools necessary to ensure secure deployment and operation
		- Specification of approved build tools and options
		- Static analysis
		- Banned APIs
		- Use of operating system "defense in depth" protections
		- Online service-specific requirements
		- Secure coding libraries
		- Consider other recommendations
	- Verification
		- Started as early as possible - conducted after the "code complete" stage
		- Start security response planning - including response plans for vulnerability reports
		- Re-evaluate attack surface
		- Fuzz testing - files, installable controls, and network-facing code
	- Release
		- Creation of a clearly defined support policy - consistent with MS corporate policies.
		- Provide a comprehensive Software Security Incident Response Plan (SSIRP)
			- Identify contacts for MSRC and resources to respond to events
			- 24x7x365 contact information for 3-5 engineers who will always be available
		- Verify that SDL requirements are met and that there are no known security vulnerabilities
			- Provides an independent view into "security ship readiness"
			- The FSR is NOT:
				- A penetration test - no "penetrate and patch" allowed
				- The first time security is reviewed
				- A signoff process
			- Key concept: the tasks for this phase are used as a determining factor on whether or not to ship.
		- Archive:
			- Customer documentation is up-to-date
			- Archive RTM source code, symbols, and threat models to a central location
			- Complete final signoff
	- Response (unique from SDLC)
		- Execution of response tasks previously outlined

### SDL Lab
- Scenario
	- Secure Instant Message for healthcare
	- Must:
		- Support desktop and mobile
		- Friendly UI
		- Real-time text and image sharing
		- Secure storage of chat logs and attachments for audit purposes
		- Admin dashboard
	- HIPAA considerations:
		- Confidentiality of Protected Health Information (PHI)
		- Access control and authentication mechanisms to restrict access to PHI
		- Audit trail for all accesses and modifications
		- Encryption for data at rest and in transit
		- Incident response and breach notification procedures
		- Risk assessments and threat modelling

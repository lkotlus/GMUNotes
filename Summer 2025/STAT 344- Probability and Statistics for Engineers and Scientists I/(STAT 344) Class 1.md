### Chapter 0
- Statistics as a field of study:
	- The science of learning from data
- Statistics:
	- Is the science of data
- The term statistics can also be used to describe numerical facts (common perception).
- Subject of statistics
	- Descriptive statistics:
		- Collect, organize, present, summarize, analyze/interpret
	- Inferential statistics:
		- Goals, draw conclusions, make inferences
	- Do all of this: when variation is present and in the face of uncertainty
- Conclusions about statistics:
	- The science of data and learning from data.
	- Collecting, organizing, presenting, summarizing, and analyzing information from data to draw conclusions, answer questions, and gain understanding.
- Data:
	- Data are observations gathered for analysis.
	- Data are also described as numbers with a context or numbers in context.
	- Units are important. "8.32" doesn't really mean anything at all without the context that units provide.
	- Data can be numerical or non-numerical (i.e. categorical)
	- We will be concerned with appropriate methods of data collection and organization.
- Language of data:
	- A data set is values for one or more variables, recording or measuring information for each case.
	- Cases are the subjects/objects/observations/individuals/units that we obtain information about.
		- We record the information for each case in a row of a data table.
	- Variables are any characteristic that is recorded for each case.
		- The variables generally correspond to the columns in a data table.
- Types of variables
	- Categorical 
		- These divides cases into groups, placing each case in exactly one or more categories
		- It is a variable that can be identified by noting its presence.
		- Categorical variables describe qualities of the case, also known as qualitative data.
		- Examples: hair color, zip code, letter grade, etc.
		- Types of qualitative/categorical data:
			- Nominal
				- Used to categorize or classify data into unordered groups.
				- Example: Academic programs
			- Ordinal
				- Data are still in categories, but now follow a natural ordering
				- Example: letter grades
	- Quantitative:
		- These variables measure/record a numerical quantity for each case.
		- Numerical operations like adding and averaging make sense for these.
		- Also known as numerical data since the values of these variables will always be numbers.
		- Examples: temperature, height, length, etc.
		- Types of quantitative/numerical data:
			- Discrete:
				- Assumes values that can be counted
				- Example: number of students in a class
			- Continuous:
				- Assumes all values between any two specific values
				- Example: range of heights of students taking a class
- Example: classifying data:

|Variable|Numerical|Categorical|
|-|-|-|
|Height of a bridge|X||
|GPA|X||
|Letter grade||X|
|Hours worked each week|X||
|Type of pets owned||X|
|Flower varieties in a garden||X|

- Another way to identify variables
	- When two variables are involved in a study, they are often classified as explanatory and response variables.
	- Explanatory:
		- The variable we think is "explaining" the change in the response variable.
	- Response:
		- The variable we think is being impacted or changed by the explanatory variable. The variable that "responds" to changes in the explanatory variable.
	- Example:
		- A dataset shows some relation between schools size and having a football team
		- Explanatory: size
		- Response: football team
- Variable relationships:
	- When making comparisons, we would like to:
		- Determine when there is an association between out two variables
		- Determine when we can conclude the outcome of one variable causes an outcome of the other.
	- Answers to these questions will rely on how our data are collected and/or sampled.
- Populations and samples:
	- Population:
		- Consists of all individuals or objects of interest. Often the group being studied.
		- Descriptive measures of populations are called parameters. Parameters are often written using Greek letters as symbols.
	- Sample:
		- A group selected from the population or a subset of the population. It provides information used to infer information about populations.
		- Descriptive measures of samples are called statistics. Statistics are often written using Roman letters as their symbols.
	- Samples are often used because getting access to an entire population is difficult.
	- Descriptive statistics is used to display facts about a sample.
	- Statistical inference is used to explain facts about the population from a sample.
- Summary:
	- Data are everywhere, and pertain to a wide variety of topics.
	- A dataset is usually comprised of variables measured on cases/observations.
	- Variables are either categorical or quantitative.
	- Data can be used to provide information about essentially anything we are interested in and want to collect data on!

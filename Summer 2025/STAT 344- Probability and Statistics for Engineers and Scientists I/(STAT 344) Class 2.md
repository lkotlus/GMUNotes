### What Do Engineers Do?
- Engineers solve problems of interest in society with efficient applications of scientific principles by:
	- Refining existing products or processes (new features, iPhone 1 -> iPhone 2)
	- Designing new products or processes (new products, flip phone -> smart phone)
- The engineering method:
	- The way that we solve these problems. It is a linear process, with an iterative refining period:
	- Identify the important factors
	- Conduct experiments
	- Propose or refine a model
- Statistics support the engineering method:
	- The field of stats deals with the collection, presentation, analysis, and use of data to:
		- Make decisions
		- Solve problems
		- Design products and processes
	- It's the science of data, this is inherently useful for engineering.
- Variability
	- Statistical methods are useful to describe and understand variability.
	- Variability is the phenomenon that leads to successive observations of a system or phenomenon where the viewed results are not identical.
	- Incorporating variability into decision making processes is called statistical thinking
	- Statistics provides a framework for describing this variability and learning about potential sources of variability.

- Basic methods of data collection
	- Three basic methods:
		- Retrospective study
			- Data collected in the past for other purposes
			- Pros: lots of data
			- Cons: might be inaccurate or not be useful
		- Observational study
			- Data, presently collected, by a passive observer
			- Pros: lots of data
			- Cons: might not be able to passively get the required data
		- Designed experiment
			- Data collected in response to process input changes
			- Pros: gets exactly the data you need
			- Cons: you need to run the experiment
- Hypothesis tests
	- A statement about some aspect of the system, compared to a claim about another process value. Data is gathered to support or refute  the claim.
	- You have a hypothesis, you test the hypothesis.
- How change is detected
	- A control chart is used.
		- Time-oriented horizontal axis
		- Variable-of-interest vertical axis
	- Long-term average is plotted as the center line.
	- Long-term usual variability is plotted as upper and lower control limits around the long-term average.
		- Limits typically located at 3 standard deviations away from center line
	- A sample size$n$ is taken and the averages are plotted over time. If the plotted points are between the control limits, then the process is normal; if not, it needs to be adjusted.
- Use of control charts:
	- Two purposes of control charts
		1. Enumerative studies: control chart of past production lots, used for lot-by-lot acceptance sampling
		2. Analytical studies: real-time control of a production process
- Mechanistic and empirical models
	- Mechanistic model
		- Built from our underlying knowledge of the basic physical mechanism that relates several variables. 
		- We know that Ohm's law is $I=\frac{V}{R}$
		- Essentially, the form of the <u>function is known</u>.
	- Empirical model
		- Built from our engineering and scientific knowledge of the phenomenon, but not directly developed from our theoretical or first-principles understanding of the underlying mechanism.
		- The form of the function is not known *a priori*
		- Example:
			- We know all the variables
			- We have a bunch of data
			- We can use a line fit to get the form of our function from the data and the variables
			- Physics lab!
		- Let's say we're trying to get pull strength from wire length and die height. This is what a regression model would look like: $$\text{pull strength}=\beta_0+\beta_1(\text{wire length})+\beta_2(\text{die height})+\epsilon$$
		- This will yield results such as: $$\widehat{\text{Pull Strength}}=2.26+2.74(\text{wire length})+0.0125(\text{die height})$$
	- Models can reflect uncertainty
		- Probability models help quantify the risks involved in statistical inference, that is, risks involved in decisions made very day.
		- Probability provides the framework for the study and application of statistics.
		- Probability concepts will be introduced next lecture!

### Next Project
- I don't want to be here.
- Issue, Audience, and Genre (IAG) Analysis. That's what we're doing. This is so stupid, I don't want to be here.
- Steps
	- Solidify issue resolution in more detail
	- Matching the argument for resolution to an appropriate stakeholder audience (real world person/organization who can do something)
	- Planning how to present, frame, and organize the argument within
	- Planning how to present, frame, and organize the argument in the final project (advocacy letter) and it's genre **conventions**.
- The most rational escape would be to take my life. The materials I have available are all school supplies, but I think if I were to take the 0.5 mm graphite in my pencil bag I might be able to force it up my nasal cavity fast enough to penetrate into my brain. Worst case scenario I just need to leave with a nosebleed. 
- Stakeholders:
	- Must have power to influence and alter the issue
	- Need to be convinced in some way before implementing my solution
	- They have a vested interest (monetary gain or otherwise) in the issue (optional)
- "Levels" of society:
	- Level 1: public sector
	- Level 2: private sector
	- Level 3: individuals with cultural leverage

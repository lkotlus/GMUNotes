### Continuing with IAG Analysis
- My issue analysis seems to be good.
- All the work this week is just assisting us with making the issue and audience analysis.
- Researching stakeholder audience background, motivations, bias, and incentives:
	- The name says everything, actually showing up to these lectures is an insurmountable waste of time.
	- Ballotpedia seems like a good source.
	- foia.gov/agency-search.html seems neat.
- Everything getting shown on class is available online. I don't understand why we spend the entire time on class discussing it.

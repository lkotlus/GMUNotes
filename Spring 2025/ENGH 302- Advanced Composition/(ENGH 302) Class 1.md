### Academic Journal vs. Academic Database
- This is going to be a distinction that we have to be clear on.
- Academic journals are like magazines, they are published on a regular basis.
- A database is a collection of issues of the academic journals.
- This man is obsessed with CTRL+F.

### Week 2 Reflective Journal
- We have four questions:
	1. Revise/refine the question (if needed)
	2. Initial scholarly article to use.
		- Share how we found it, what the genre is, why we picked it, etc.
	3. Find a popular news article for the same purpose.
		- Share about it, same stuff
	4. Make a plan for getting the rest of the sources
		- Setting up guidelines for search terms, where to look for them, etc.

### How to Find Sources
- Scholarly, popular, trade, and grey sources. We want to collect all four kinds, and we want to do it effectively.
	- Current state is best reviewed by news articles and trade news reports.
	- Historical background, structural causes, and technical context is best from scholarly articles and trade research reports.
	- Competing arguments and perspectives are best for grey sources.
- Google News and Google Scholar are always good.
- Use the library search things, just read the instructions, it isn't hard.
- Trade sources are best found with "trade journals for \[profession\]". There's also curated lists of sources for this.
- Boolean operators, my love, my sweet, my shining star.

### Genres Within Sources
- Even within news articles, there are kinds of news articles. How do we figure out the genre of our sources?
- Some genres:
	- Articles
		- Investigative journalism (results of an investigation)
		- Explanatory journalism (add nuance and context to a topic)
		- Opinion articles (gives an opinion)
	- Scholarly sources
		- Original research (the author(s) did research and reported results)
		- Literature review (the scholar reads other articles and abstracts what they all have to say, mapping out the conversation)
		- Meta-analysis (quantitative research version of a literature review, done through data analytics)
	- Trade sources
		- Trade news report (report industry-based news)
		- Trade research reports (report industry-based research)
		- Industry profile (industry equivalent of a literature review)
	- <u>**Note that commercial sources are distinct from trade sources. They are written for product-promotion and are biased.**</u>

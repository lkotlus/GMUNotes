### Research Log Draft
- Due Wednesday, might get an extension. I will be turning it in on Wednesday.
- You need hyperlinks in source credibility, and you need to reference the paragraph that you pull things from. There is a full example research log in the prompt document.
- Columns:
	- Source Summary: 3-4 sentences summarizing the content.
	- Key Research Contributions: Longer, give some quotes. Most important section of the log.
	- Rhetorical Context:
		- Exigence: what incited the writer to write
		- Purpose: what the writer hopes to achieve
		- Audience: the people who will read it

### Follow-Up Research Moves
- We didn't actually talk about this very much. This entire class is a giant waste of everyone's time.

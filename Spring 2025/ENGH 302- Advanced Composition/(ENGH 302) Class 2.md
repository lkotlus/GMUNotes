### Intro
- This man apologizes more than any professor I have met in my entire life.
- "Sorry that we started 3 minutes late and that the lecture will be lecture-heavy."
	- What?

### Distinguishing Databases from Journals
- Don't be an idiot.

### Critical Reading Strategies
- If the source is ~2000 words long:
	- Read it in full
	- Take notes along the way
- If the source is a much longer scholarly journal article or grey report/paper:
	- Focus on the important sections
		- Abstract
		- Introduction
		- Results/findings/discussion
		- Conclusion
	- Take notes on these, rather than the full thing
- Make sure you get three of the five:
	- Effect of the issue
	- Causes behind the issue
	- Potential solutions to the issue
	- Stakeholders within the issue
	- Context/background for the issue

### Narrowing Down our Sources
- If something isn't objective, get rid of it.
- If something has misinformation, get rid of it.
- If you don't like it, get rid of it.
- This class is a waste of everyone's time.

### Columns
- We have the columns in our stupid matrix thing. We need to know what they are and what they mean.
- They are:
	- Publication context:
		- Source type, genre, citation
	- Search Terms:
		- Just the search terms
	- Source credibility:
		- Do a content evaluation.
		- Do a venue evaluation.
	- Source summary:
		- Description of the messages/claims/ideas, supporting evidence, etc.
		- Just the source alone.
	- Key Research Contributions:
		- Key insights and specific ideas that the source added.
		- How the source moves me closer toward potential answers. 
		- Explain effects, causes, solutions, stakeholders, and background from the source.
		- What the source does for me.
	- Follow-up research moves:
		- Things you do to keep researching.
	- New keywords:
		- Duh.
- This entire class makes me want to perform an impromptu lobotomy on myself using the nearest available freshly sharpened number 2 pencil. Preferably a yellow one with the green metallic thing to hold the eraser in. A classic number 2 pencil. The kind to make you start doing SAT prep as soon as possible. Y'know?

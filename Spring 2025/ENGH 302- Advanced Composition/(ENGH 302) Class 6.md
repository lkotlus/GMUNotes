### Synthesis Essay
- Structure of the essay:
	- Open with necessary context (1-2 paragraphs).
	- Explain research (bulk of the essay).
	- Conclude with your thesis (1 paragraph).
- That is literally the entire thing. Why do we have an entire lecture on this?
- We want to build up the the thesis, guiding our research towards it. Do I need to make this even more obvious? Do I need to get up onto a podium and scream out to the entire world "breath air", and that's how I become an English professor? I think that I would rather literally kick dogs as my job all day rather than steal money from people and parade around as if I am contributing to the world. That's every single one of these professors, that's just what they do. He isn't **teaching** anything, and he knows it. HE KNOWS IT. I cannot stand this, I am enraged. This is far too much for my sensibilities, and I must take a nap for five hours to recover from the emotional toll that it has taken on me.
- In-class stupidity activity:
	1. The issue is that we don't have a standardized and efficient framework for risk analysis, but we very desperately need one. There's a bunch to choose from, we keep making more, and many can't be implemented.
	2. We just need to take that machine-learning linear regression adversarial risk model and standardize it through FedRAMP. It's ML, so easy to share the implementation through software, it's linear regression, so we can get the performance boost from that, and it's adversarial risk analysis, so well known and effective. FedRAMP compliance is required for nearly every large tech company as well as small companies that work with the government, so this is the best thing to do. Not a perfect, but a framework that is <u>good enough</u>.
- Most useless class imaginable.

Look at me, I already know the entire language and all of the features within it.

### First day of class!
- This total bro dude held the first day of class online instead of letting me actually go to the lecture. Not cool.
- We get a full page of notes for exams, that's neat. It will be a fill in the blank kind of format.
- Save untouched (metadata still shows before the due date, although we both know I can spoof this) copy of each assignment just in case.
- For the first bit of the course all development will be done in UNIX and vim/vi. This should be no problem, seeing as this is already my development environment.

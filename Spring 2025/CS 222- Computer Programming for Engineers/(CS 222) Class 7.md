### I better learn something today.
- I am so tired and just wanted to stay in bed. If I don't learn things I am going to be pissed.
- Homework 1 grades are back, so that's nice.

### Time Complexity
- I ought to pulverize my L4 vertebrae such that I might not always be in such pain.
- Print statement: $O(1)$
- For loop ($k$ levels of nesting): $O(n^k)$
- Binary search: $O(\log(n))$
- Quicksort: $O(n \log(n))$

### Libraries and Linking Object Files
- We need to link our code together when compiling.
- Make libraries with commands.
- I want to go to sleep.

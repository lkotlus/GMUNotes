### Midterm Review 
- We're going over:
	1. User defined functions
	2. Functions with arrays
	3. Evaluation rules and operator precedence
	4. Pointers
		- `x == &x[0]`, and `x[i] == *(x+i)`
	5. Validating input
	6. Strings
	7. Visualizing in memory
	8. Small amount of material on structs.
- Pretty easy looking.
- *Raise my hand...* "Yeah, go ahead."
	- He knew it was coming before it even happened.

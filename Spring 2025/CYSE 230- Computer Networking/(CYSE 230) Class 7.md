### Midterm Prep
- So we have a study guide on Blackboard.
	- More detailed in lecture slides
		- Most detailed in the textbook, which you will 300 pages of
- We don't need to memorize formulas, but we can put them on our cheat sheet.
	- Better to understand concepts behind them, of course. You will get this from the textbook.

### Chapter 1 Review
- The internet is a network of networks.
- Network edges are hosts, and hosts have applications.
- Network components:
	- Network edges. Made of hosts, either clients or servers.
	- Access networks. Access networks and physical media make up the connecting components of the internet. Access network physically connects an end system to the first router (edge router) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system.
		- Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks.
		- Wired and wireless are both options for this.
	- Network core. Made up of interconnected routers. Routers have two functions: forwarding (local action) and routing (global action)
		- ***There will be a question on these!***
- Packet switching vs. Circuit switching.
	- Packet switching is first come first serve
		- All users use all channels, sending information in packets.
		- More users can use the network!
	- Circuit switching is like a reserved restaurant
		- User gets a channel, they use the channel as much as they want.
		- Users get uninterrupted service.
		- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) and Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) are used.
	- ***There will be a question on the two types of switching and their pros/cons!***
- Performance
	- ***There will be a question on processing/queuing/transmission/propagation delay!***
	- Know how to calculate!
	- Processing: hardware running necessary computations
	- Queuing delay: packets wait their turn because of limited number of channels
	- Transmission: bits per second and packet size
	- Propagation delay: wire/distance and data speed
- Protocols:
	- ***There will be a question on layering. What it is, what it's benefits are, and OSI.***
	- 5 Layer OSI is the same as the TCP/IP model.
		- Application (Application, Presentation, Session are different in the 7-layer OSI)
		- Transport 
		- Network
		- Data link
		- Physical
	- Protocols define the format and order of messages that are sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission and reception.
	- Know which protocols go on which layer.
	- **Know what HTTP stands for.**

### Chapter 2 Review
- ***There will be a question on what the function of the Application Layer is and how it works with the Transport Layer. Know how it is used by the end-user and host.***
- ***List protocols required to transfer information.***
- Public and private protocols are a thing.
- Interacts with transport layer through sockets!
- ***Know the source vs. destination port and IPs.***
- Client-server architecture:
	- Servers:
		- Servers are "always-on hosts"
		- Static IP
		- Often in data centers for scaling
	- Clients:
		- Contact and communicate with the server
		- My be intermittently connected
		- Dynamic IP
		- Do not communicate directly with each other (in client-server)
		- HTTP, IMAP, FTP, etc. are all client-server protocols. 
- P2P:
	- File sharing with BitTorrent can scale far better.
	- Torrent means all peers share the same resource
	- Faster after a certain number of people join.
	- No always-on server. Arbitrary end systems directly communicate.
	- Peers request service from other peers and provide service in return to other peers.
	- Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses, makes for some complex management.
	- ***Know basic BitTorrent stuff***
	- ***Know which protocols are client-server and which protocols are P2P***
- Email:
	- ***Know email stuff, difference between POP3 and IMAP***
- HTTP:
	- Persistent (establish connection, request several objects) and non-persistent (request one object at a time) exist.
	- ***HTTP is stateless, we manage state with cookies***
- In summary:
	- ***HTTP!***
		- Persistent and non-persistent
		- HTTP/1
		- HTTP/1.1
		- HTTP/2
	- ***Email!***
		- 3 components
		- Email servers
		- Sending servers
	- ***DNS!***
		- Distributed hierarchical database
		- Record types
		- Layers of servers
		- Iterated and recursive queries. Most use iterated today.
		- Reverse DNS lookup does not count!
	- ***What is a P2P network, how does it work, what are the benefits and drawbacks?***
	- ***What protocol uses BitTorrent, what is BitTorrent, and how does it work?***
	- ***Video streaming transmission rates and CDNs.***

### Chapter 3 Review
- TCP vs. UDP:
	- TCP:
		- Reliable transport
		- Flow control
		- Congestion control
		- Doesn't provide timing, minimum throughput guarantee, or security
		- Connection oriented
	- UDP:
		- Unreliable data transfer,
		- Doesn't provide reliability, flow control, congestion control, timing, throughput guarantee, security, or connection setup.
	- We send data in frames.
- ***Know all rdt versions (1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, and 3)***
	- Also go-back-N and selective repeat
- Flow and congestion control!
	- Flow control is send/receive buffers. It's caused by the server sending too fast.
	- Congestion control is insane, it's caused by server receiving bombardment of requests.
- ***What is multiplexing/demultiplexing, how do they work? Differences between TCP and UDP demultiplexing.***
	- TCP uses source and destination IP and port
	- UDP only uses source IP and port
- ***Know services that use UDP vs. TCP.***
- ***Know inner workings of TCP!***
	- And I mean everything about it
- ***Calculate checksums!***

### Final Exam Prep
- Final is on the 13th.
- It will be cumulative, she reuses questions though so go back and look at feedback.
- There will still be more focus on later content!
	- Go-Back-N and selective repeat especially!
	- The rdt question as well!
- Network Layer (data plane)
	- Two key functions are forwarding (go from input link to output link) and routing (planning out the "whole trip")
	- Longest prefix matching determines which link interface we use for an IP address.
	- We have two algorithms for routing:
		- Link State
		- Distance Vector
	- Classful addressing vs. classless
		- Put classes in the cheat sheet!
		- Put how CIDR works as well
			- Potentially add some masks, but seems unnecessary.
	- DHCP
		- Client-server scenario slide
		- Know how to replace things and whatnot
	- NAT
		- Network address translation slide
	- **First and last IP is .1 and .254, not .0 and .255**
- Network layer (control plane)
	- Traditional and SDN
		- Traditional is hardware working together to creating routing tables and whatnot
		- SDN is a central controller doing stuff with software
	- Link State
		- Dijkstra's algorithm
	- Distance Vector
		- Update based on propagation of data
		- Faster through PARALLEL PROCESSING, as each node can just share it's data
		- Bellman-Ford Equation is GOATED!
		- Comparisons between the two of these
	- Intra and Inter AS Routing
		- Know each protocol and generally what they do (public vs. proprietary as well). Also know which type of algorithm they use (link state vs. distance vector).
		- Intra:
			- RIP
			- EIGRP
			- OSPF
			- etc.
		- Inter:
			- BGP
				- eBGP
				- iBGP
	- SDNs
		- Three components (slides 81-83)
		- Centralized
		- Benefits/drawbacks
- Link Layer
	- Network Layer vs. Link Layer
		- Router Vs. Switch
		- MAC vs. IP
	- Error correction/detection
		- Lil' parity table
			- One dimension is weak, but 2 dimensions are great!
	- Flow control (multiple access protocols)
		- Know the ideal protocol stuff
		- Know the different protocols and how close they get
		- Four classes:
			- Channel partitioning
			- Frequency division multiplexing
			- Time division multiplexing
			- Code division multiplexing
				- Know how to do two nodes transmitting at the same time for code division multiplexing with inner product and whatnot
		- Random access protocols and whatnot
			- She's yapping on this, make sure you understand it well.
			- Go through the OG class notes on these, you took good ones.
			- Token passing, ALOHA, slotted ALOHA, CSMA, and all that
	- LANs
		- Addressing with MAC
		- ARP
		- Send frames and datagrams from host to host with routers in between.
			- Just like that homework problem
		- Ethernet is connectionless and unreliable.
	- Basic switch concepts
		- What is a switch?
		- Slide 73
		- Differences with routers, slide 83
- Wireless
	- Hidden terminal problem (most important)
	- CDMA, 2 sender especially (most important)
	- Basic 802.11 LAN architecture
	- 4G LTE architecture
	- Other wireless stuff
- Security
	- CIA triad
	- Encryption
		- Public key
		- Symmetric
		- Which algorithms are which
		- Digital signatures for non-repudiation
	- Hashing

### On the IP stuff
- We want to start with $1$ and end with $254$. 
	- TA will allow both for this one, but in the future the first and last should be 1 and 254

### Network Security
- I think...
	- I thought correctly
- Roadmap:
	- What is network security?
	- Principles of cryptography
	- Message integrity and authentication
	- Securing TCP connections (TLS)
	- Operational security (firewalls and IDS)
- Alright, alright, alright
- What is network security:
	- CIA TRIAD CIA TRIAD CIA TRIAD
		- Confidentiality (keep my secrets a secret)
		- Integrity (don't modify/corrupt my data)
		- Availability (don't DDoS me)
	- Finally talking about security in the security course.
	- Alice, Bob, and Eve
		- Alice and Bob just want to talk, but Eve is always eavesdropping
		- Eve wants to intercept, delete/add, and modify messages
		- How do we stop her?
	- Encrypt the data, idiot
		- But Eve will still see the encryption keys
			- Use public key encryption, idiot
				- Too slow to encrypt/decrypt
					- Use Diffie-Hellman to exchange symmetric key, idiot
						- Okay :(
	- That's the general idea. We're going to be doing public key most of the time, though. 
- Principles of cryptography
	- Gaming.
	- Alice and Bob want to exchange keys!
		- Public key:
			- Public keys encrypt, private keys decrypt
			- Four keys are made Alice's private and public and Bob's private and public
			- Alice sends her public key to Bob, Bob sends his public key to Alice
			- Eve can get those keys, but she's only able to encrypt data, not decrypt.
		- Symmetric:
			- Just one key for encrypting and decrypting
			- Diffie-Hellman to exchange securely
	- Substitution ciphers is dumb as hell.
		- "I want to not be very secure"
	- Symmetric key cryptography:
		- DES (Data Encryption Standard)
			- US encryption standard
			- 64-bit key
			- Block cipher with block chaining
		- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
			- Symmetric-key NIST standard, replaced DEC in 2001
			- Processes data in 128-bit block
			- 128, 192, or 256-bit keys
			- Brute force decryption takes 1 second for DES, takes 149 trillion years for AES.
	- Public key cryptography:
		- We've got some strange mumbo jumbo going on with $K_B^-(K_B^+(m))=m=K_B^+(K_b^-(m))$. I believe this is about the signature?
		- RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adelson) algorithm.
- Authentication and message integrity:
	- Digital signatures
		- We digitally sign our documents by encrypting them with the private key.
			- $K_B^+()$ is the public key, $K_B^-()$ uses the private key.
			- Asymmetric encryption is hilariously symmetric in the sense that $K_B^-(K_B^+(m))=m=K_B^+(K_b^-(m))$
		- Public key decrypts it and proves that the source is reliable.
		- Nonrepudiation!
- Operational security:
	- Firewalls:
		- Isolate the organization's internal network from the internet, allowing some packets to pass and blocking others
		- These help with:
			- Denial of service
			- Illegal modification/access of internal data
			- Authorized access inside the network
		- Two types of firewalls:
			- Stateless packet filters
				- Used in internal network, connected to the internet via router firewall
				- Flow of data packets based on predefined rules, without keeping track of the state of network connections
				- ACL (Access Control List)
				- Key features:
					- No memory of past traffic
					- Faster, but less secure
					- Filters based on criteria such as:
						- Source IP
						- Destination IP
						- Port number
						- Protocol type
				- ACLs just show us actions (allow/deny) based on criteria
				- |Action|Source Address|Destination Address|Protocol|Source Port|Destination Port|Flag Bit|
				  |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
				  |Allow|Outside of 222.22/16|222.22/16|TCP|80|> 1023|ACK|
			- Stateful packet filters
				- Maintains connection state tables (such as TCP handshake process)
				- Tracks ongoing sessions (IP, ports, sequence numbers)
				- Allows return traffic only if it matches an existing connection
				- Can prevent certain attacks such as spoofing or TCP hijacking.
	- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
		- Packet filtering:
			- Operates on TCP/IP headers only
			- No correlation check among sessions
		- IDS:
			- Deep packet inspection
				- Looks at packet contents (check character strings/file signatures against malicious code and viruses)
			- Compared with firewall
				- More sophisticated: look inside packets instead of the headers
				- More actions: take actions (sound alarm) other than silently filtering.
			- Multiple IDSs:
				- Different types of checking at different locations
				- We might have IDS set between each router in a network, specifically at a server, etc.
	- Best practices for network security:
		- Some things to do:
			- Vendor security evaluation
			- Frequent software updates
			- Network division
			- Firewall defense
			- Replication and backup
			- Data security
			- Frequent inspections and assessments
			- Employee education
		- Firewall defense:
			- Use firewalls, preferably stateful
			- Regularly update the rules
		- Network division:
			- Network segmentation is great, don't put things together if they don't need to be
			- Your sales team shouldn't be in the same subnet as your servers
		- Frequent software updates:
			- Don't be an idiot
		- Vendor security evaluation:
			- Stuff like FedRAMP, follow regulations every once in a while.
		- Employee education:
			- Don't be an idiot.
		- Frequent inspections and assessments:
			- Hire me to hack your network.
		- Data security:
			- Encrypt stuff, don't be an idiot
			- Use SSL/TLS, don't be an idiot
		- Replication and backup:
			- Don't let ransomware destroy your company

### Syllabus and Introduction
- Two kinds of assignments:
	- Lecture related assignments (lil' quiz)
	- Lab assignment (VA Cyber Range)
		- :(
- Office hours are right before class, but we can schedule other times by email. ***Use her preferred email format from the syllabus!!!***
- Course attendance is 15% of the grade. There are some pop quizzes.
- Exams are each 20% (one midterm, one final). They are in-person, but we do get one A4 size cheat-sheet with both sides of writing allowed. All memorization concepts should fit on this.
- This woman is so gentle and wholesome. She must be protected.

### Introduction to Networking
- What is a network?
	- A group of connect devices.
	- We will frequently use the internet as an example of a network. The internet is a network of networks.
	- "Collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology."
- The internet has become popular due to applications and appliances that use it.
- What about the components and infrastructure of the internet?
	- Devices:
		- Hosts and apps
	- Packet switches:
		- Routers and switches
	- Communication links:
		- Fiber, copper, radio, satellite
		- Transmission rate is called **bandwidth**
	- Network:
		- Collection of devices, routers, and links. Managed by an organization.
- Overview of networks:
	- The internet as a network of networks is connected by ISPs
	- Protocols are everywhere:
		- HTTP, TCP, IP, WiFi, Ethernet, etc.
	- Internet standards
		- RFC: Request For Comments
		- IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force
- We switching to IPv6 soon (never)!!!
- What's a protocol?
	- It's just a set of rules for communication. A standard that we adhere to.
	- Define the format and order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission.
	- A set of rules, conventions, and data structures that enable devices to communicate and exchange information over a network.
		- Ensure reliable, efficient, and secure data transmission.
		- Operate at various layers of the OSI Model or the TCP/IP Model, each serving a specific function.
- A closer look at internet structure:
	- Network edge:
		- Hosts: clients and servers
		- Servers are often in data centers
		- We running processes on these bad boys
	- Access networks, physical media:
		- Wired and wireless communication links
- Host: sends packets of data
	- Takes application message
	- Breaks into smaller chunks, known as packets, of length $L$ bits.
	- Transmits packet into access network at transmission rate $R$
	- Link transmission rate, aka link capacity, aka link bandwidth is $\frac{L}{R}$.
- Links (physical media)
	- Bit: propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
	- Physical link: what lies between transmitter and receiver
	- Guided media: signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
	- Unguided media: signals propagate freely (like radio)
	- Twisted pair (TP): 
		- Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps Ethernet
		- Category 6: 10 Gbps Ethernet 
		- Two insulated copper wires, twisted in a helix. OFten twisted pairs go by the bundle.
		- Due  to their adequate performance and low cost, twisted pairs are widely used.
		- UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)
			- CAT3 8 cores, 16 MHz bandwidth, 10 Mbps
			- ...
	- Coaxial Cable:
		- Single lil' guy
	- Fiber optic:
		- Speed of light! Glass fiber carrying light pulses.
		- Low error rate, high speed.
		- Expensive :(
	- Radio:
		- Wireless radio:
			- Signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
			- No physical wire
			- Broadcast and "half-duplex"
			- Propagation environment effects:
				- Reflection
				- Obstruction by objects
				- Interference
		- Bandwidth (Hz):
			- The range of frequencies transmitted without being strongly attenuated.
			- Bandwidth is a physical property of the transmission medium, and usually depends on the construction, thickness, and length of the medium.
			- A wide band signal will be distorted when transmitted through relatively narrower band channel with the certain harmonics cut off.
			- Bandwidth is physical and related to physics.
- Access networks:
	- What is it?
		- The part of a computer network that connects end-user devices to the broader network.
			- Often through a service provider or enterprise network. 
	- Example:
		- Home networks!
		- You have cables, WiFi, routers, switches, etc.
		- The home network connects to the internet with an ISP.
	- Cable-based access
	- Digital Subscriber Line (DSL):
		- Existing telephone line to central office
			- Data over DSL phone line goes to the internet
			- Voice over DSL telephone network
	- Wireless access networks:
		- Shared wireless access network connects end system to router (via base station, or "access point").
		- Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)
	- Enterprise networks:
		- Companies, universities, etc.
- Network core:
	- Interconnected routers
	- Network of networks
	- Two key network-core functions:
		- Forwarding:
			- Local action
		- Routing:
			- Global action
	- Packet switching:
		- Store and forward:
			- Transmission delay: takes $\frac{L}{R}$ seconds to transmit (push out) $L$-bit packet into link at $R$ BPS.
			- Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on the next link
			- End-end delay: $\frac{2L}{R}$ (above), assuming zero propagation delay
		- Queuing delay and loss:
			- If arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for a period of time:
				- Packet will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link
				- Packets can drop if memory in the router fills up.
	- Circuit Switching: FDM and TDM:
		- Frequency Division Multiplexing:
			- Optical, electromagnetic frequencies divided into frequency bands.
			- Each call allocated its own band, can transmit at max rate of that narrow band.
			- Each user gets a small number of frequencies, which they can use at any time
		- Time Division Multiplexing:
			- Time divided into slots
			- Each call allocated periodic slot(s), can transmit at maximum rate of (wider) frequency band, but only during its time slot(s).
			- Each user gets a time to use any frequency (e.g., user 1 gets to send data every 5 ms).
	- Is packet switching always better?
		- Great for "bursty" data.
			- Resource sharing
			- Simpler, no call setup
		- Excessive congestion possible: packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow
			- Protocols needed for reliable data transfer and congestion control
		- How to provide circuit-like behavior:
			- Bandwidth guarantees traditionally used for audio/video applications
		- Human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching) versus on-demand resources (packet switching)
	- Internet structure: a "network of networks"
		- Given millions of access ISPs, how do we go about connecting them all together?
		- Well, we don't want to connect each ISP to every other ISP, that would be horrible. 
		- Options:
			- Connect each access ISP to one global transit ISP? 
				- Can't do this, we will end up with competitors and it would be a huge mess.
			- Let's just add "internet exchange points" (IXPs) and "peering links" to join the global transit ISPs. 
			- Furthermore, we'll do some regional ISPs.
- Performance (loss, delay, throughput)
	- Processing delay (router needs to extract data from packets, this takes time)
	- Queuing delay (packets need to wait their turn because of the limited number of channels)
	- Transmission delay (we are restrained by the bits per second and the size of the packet)
	- Propagation delay (how long is the wire/distance to the recipient, and how fast is our data moving)
	- How do packet loss and delay occur?
		- Packets queue and wait for their turn
		- Arrival rate to link (temporarily) exceeds output link capacity, and that leads to packet loss
		- Packet delay is created by the nodal delay: $d_{nodal}=d_{processing}+d_{queue}+d_{transmission}+d_{propagation}$.
			- $d_{processing}$ is $\frac{L}{R}$
			- $d_{propagation}$ is $\frac{d}{s}$ (distance over speed).
			- These two are very different. One is data size and processing rate, the other is physical distance and speed.
	- Packet queuing delay (revisited):
		- $R$: link bandwidth (bps)
		- $L$: packet length (bits)
		- $a$: average packet arrival rate
	- Throughput:
		- Rate (bits/time) at which bits are being sent from sender to receiver
		- Throughput is subject to bottle necking. 
- Security
	- Network security is important for security, almost all attacks occur remotely over a network.
- Go through the slides again, lectures for this class aren't great but you'll get through it. Shouldn't be terribly difficult.

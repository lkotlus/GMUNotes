### Solutions of DEs
- Recall the question from last class, given the function and the differential equation, determine if the function is a valid solution: $$y=1+t$$ $$\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{y^2-1}{t^2+2t}$$
- Plug in $y$ in terms of $t$, differentiate $y$, and see if it's true. 
- This easily shows us that $y=1+t$ is a solution.
- An equilibrium solution is a constant function that satisfies a differential equation.
- Now take the question:
	- Give the differential equation, find all functions that satisfy it: $$\frac{dP}{dt}=0.3P$$
	- Easy enough, by inspection we get $P=ke^{0.3t}$.

### Qualitative and Graphical Approaches
- Some definitions:
	- <u>**Slope Field**</u>:
		- Graphical representation of a DE
		- Plugging in any coordinate into a differential equation will give a tangent vector to the solution at that point
		- There is a tangent vector on every point.
	- <u>**Autonomous Equation**</u>:
		- When your DE doesn't depend on the independent variable: $$\frac{d^ny}{dt^n}=f(y)$$
	- <u>**Initial Condition**</u>:
		- A value for our DE solution, typically at $t=0$.

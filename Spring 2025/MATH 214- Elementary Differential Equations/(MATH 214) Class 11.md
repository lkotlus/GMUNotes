### Warm-up
- The DE below predicts the owl population/year in a forest ($P$ is in hundreds of owls): $$\frac{dP}{dt}=\frac P2\left(1-\frac P5\right)\left(\frac P8-1\right)$$
- Scientists estimate $P$ is about 5, so they make long-term predictions with initial conditions: $P=4.9,5,5.1$. Without a graphing calculator or software, determine long-term predictions for these ICs for the DE. Are they similar, or radically different? Can we carry out a similar analysis if the current number is around 8?
	- We will start by saying that we are given $P(0)\approx 5$.
	- This establishes that we begin at $t=0$.
	- So we want to see the behavior of $P(0)=4.9$, $P(0)=5.0$, and $P(0)=5.1$.
	- Observe equilibrium solutions at $P=0, 5, 8$. That tells us that we decrease at less than 5, if it's between 5 and 8 we will go to 8, and if we are above 8 we will decrease to 8.
	- So we can see that for...
		- $P(0)=4.9$, we will decrease to 0
		- $P(0)=5$, we will stay at 5
		- $P(0)=5.1$, we will increase to 8
	- Perfect. Repeating the process around 8:
		- $P(0)=7.9$, we will increase to 8
		- $P(0)=8$, we will stay at 8
		- $P(0)=8.1$, we will decrease to 8
- We can see that for some equilibrium solutions, we always approach. For others, we are always going away from it. $P=0$ is approached from both sides, same for $P=8$, but $P=5$ isn't being approached from anywhere but itself.
- So if we start around 5, we diverge from it. If we start around 8, we converge to it.

### Stability of Autonomous Differential Equations
- Autonomous DEs are ones that are only in terms of the solution function. $\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y)$ is autonomous.
- For the owl example from above:
	- Why does it make sense that the population will die out if it drops below 5?
		- Population can't support itself.
	- What's different about the equilibrium solutions at 8 and 5?
		- 8 is stable, 5 is unstable.
- We can make wild assertions about constant behavior because direction will only change when we hit 0 for our DE. This makes sense. We have intervals of change.
- <u>**Phase Line**</u>:
	- A 1-d diagram that depicts qualitative behavior of solutions to an autonomous DE.
	- We put dotted circles around equilibrium solutions and arrows pointing in the direction of the DE around them.
- Is there such a thing as half-stable?
	- Yes, called "semi-stable"

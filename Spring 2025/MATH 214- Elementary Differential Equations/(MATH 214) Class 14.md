### Modelling with Autonomous DEs
- Warm up:
	- Literally identical to last week's stuff, make a column through average rate of change. Easy stuff. $$\frac{dy}{dt}\approx \frac{y_{n+1}-y_n}{t_{n+1}-t_n}$$
	- In this case, we have a table of initial population and population after 1 day $\Delta t=1$. That tells us that $\frac{dy}{dt}\approx y_{n+1}-y_n$, which  is neat.
- **<u>Definition</u>**:
	- Autonomous Derivative Graph
	- The graph of $\frac{dP}{dt}$ vs $P$ when $\frac{dP}{dt}$ is an autonomous DE.
- Describe initial conditions in words:
	1. We will decrease to 0 (population cannot support under 3).
	2. We will hold at that population (equilibrium at 3).
	3. We will increase to about 6 (stable, but the population max).
	4. We will increase to about 6 (stable, but under the population max).
	5. We will hold at that population (at the population max).
	6. We will decrease to about 6 (past the population max).
- Equilibrium solutions count as prototypical solutions.

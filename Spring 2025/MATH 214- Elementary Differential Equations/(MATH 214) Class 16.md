### Systems of Differential Equations
- Recall the idea of the 3-dimensional plot.
- Rabbits and foxes.
- Some questions:
	- What are our predictions for the initial conditions: $R(0)=3$ and $F(0)=0$?
		- Rabbits will go to infinity
	- Using all three different views of the graph, show how this supports our conclusions.
		- Foxes-rabbits graph shows that rabbits are increasing as foxes stay at 0
		- Foxes-time graph shows that foxes stay at 0
		- Rabbit-time graph shows that rabbits are increasing to infinity
	- With $R(0)=3$ and $F(0)=2$, what happens as time continues?
		- We keep cycling in populations.
	- I would rather carve open my abdomen with a shard of glass and hang myself by my own entrails than sit through this any longer. Ridiculously slow paced.

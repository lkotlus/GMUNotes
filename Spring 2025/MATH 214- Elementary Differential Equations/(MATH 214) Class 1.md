I hope you're excited to type a lot of $\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}}$.

### Populations
- Homework is submitted via gradescope. 
- This will be an active learning classroom. There's going to be a lot of involvement.
- Open-ended nature of problems are intended to promote:
	- Explaining reasoning
	- Listening to other people's reasoning
	- etc.
- Warm up:
	- Which system is two species competing, and which is cooperating?
		- $$\frac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}=-5x+2xy$$ $$\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}t}=-4y+3xy$$
		- $$\frac{\text{d}x}{\text{d}t}=4x-2xy$$ $$\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}t}=2y-xy$$
	- Assumptions:
		- $x$ is the population for species 1
		- $y$ is the population for species 2
		- $t$ is time
	- Observations:
		- In scenario 1, we can see that the rate of change for population goes down for an individual species, but goes up with the product of both populations.
		- In scenario 2, we can see that the opposite is true. We increase by the individual and decrease by the product.
	- Reasoning:
		- When two species are cooperative, they increase together in population and decrease alone.
		- From this, if we increase by the product and decrease by the individual, we must be cooperative.
		- From this, example one is cooperative and example two is competitive.
- Smooth jazz really helps with the class environment, for real.

### Qualitative and Graphical Approaches
- Only one species for this
- Speices has been in its habitat for some time prior to what we call $t=0$.
- Species has access to unlimited resources.
- Species reproduces continuously.
- Problem:
	- Sketch three population versus time graphs: one starting at $P=10$, another at $P=20$, and a third at $P=30$.
	- For the graph starting at $P=10$, how does the slope vary as time increases?
		- Exponentially
	- For the set $P$ value, say $P=30$, how do slopes vary across the three graphs you drew?
		- The slopes are all identical at $p=30$
	- Equation for the graph should be:
		- $\frac{\text{d}P}{\text{d}t}=P_oe^t$
		- $P_o$ should be the initial value, since $e^0$ is 1, so to produce the correct population at $P_o$, we must multiply it by the initial population value that we desire.
		- This also results in my very much realizing that I was heavily mistaken in the conversation.
		- Everything in this section above this is wrong. Our slopes must be the same at any $P=n$, so we need to be independent of $t$. This just leaves $2P$.

### Definitions
- A Differential Equation is an equation relating an unknown function to its derivative(s).
- The order of a DE is the highest derivative that appears within the DE.
- Solution of a DE is a function that satisfies the rate of change equation.
- Question:
	- How would you read $\frac{\text{d}y}{\text{d}t}=y+2t$ with meaning?
		- There is some function $y(t)$, which has a rate of change equal to itself plus $2t$.

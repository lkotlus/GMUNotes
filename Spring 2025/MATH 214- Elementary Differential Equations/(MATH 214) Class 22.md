### Warm up
- We talked about the exam extra credit problem.
- Construct an argument that almost all solutions in the phase plane head into the origin with a slope of -1:
	- To start, because our solutions are in the form $\begin{bmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{bmatrix}=e^{-C_1t}\ \overrightarrow{v}_1+e^{-C_2t}\ \overrightarrow{v}_2$, ($C_1<C_2$) we know that $(x,y)\rightarrow (0,0)$ only as $t\rightarrow\infty$.
	- Because $t\rightarrow\infty\ \ \forall(x,y)\rightarrow(0,0)$, then we know that we will always have the situation where influence from $\overrightarrow{v}_2$ disappears.
	- As long as we don't approach along $\overrightarrow{v}_2$, we end up curling towards $\overrightarrow{v}_1$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$.

### Continuing on systems
- General solutions: $$\begin{bmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\end{bmatrix}=k_1e^{3t}\begin{bmatrix}1\\3\end{bmatrix}+k_2e^{-5t}\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}$$
- Linear combinations, like a nerd.

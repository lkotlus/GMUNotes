### CAD Tools and VHDL
- We don't have any assignments with VHDL, we're doing Verilog. Not sure why we're doing this.
- Software does all the work for us.
- VHDL and Verilog are standards taht offer portability across different CAD tools and different types of programmable chips.

### Optimizing Things (K-Maps)
- We needed to learn this a week ago!
- Karnaugh Maps are faster and easier than Boolean Algebra.
- You were just short of inventing these week 2 of class.
- Lot's of fun learning these on our own last week, definitely doesn't make coming to class a giant waste of time or anything like that.

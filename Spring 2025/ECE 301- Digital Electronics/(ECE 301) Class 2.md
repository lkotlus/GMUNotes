### Chapter 1 information
- FPGAs, cool stuff.
- Missed 10 minutes because chain fell off the bike. Of course.
- We will be going through the development process in this course for digital circuits.
- Hierarchical design:
	- Computer
		- PSU, motherboard, printed circuit boards
			- Integrated circuits, connectors, and components
				- Subcircuits on a chip
					- Logic gates (focus of the course)
						- Transistors (less than a third of the course)
							- Transistors on a chip

### Chapter 2 information
- Number systems!
	- We love binary, we definitely aren't learning it for the thousandth time
	- We're actually learning it a bit cooler this time.
		- All number systems have a ***radix point***, which separates the fractional component from the integer component: $$[k_{n-1}k_{n-2}...k_{0}\cdot k_{-1}k_{-2}...k_{m-1}]_r$$
		- That describes a base $r$ number with $n$ integer digits and $m$ fractional digits. The dot in the middle is our radix point.
	- We use hex for more complex systems, as they more efficiently represent larger numbers.
- Logic circuits!
	- Logic circuits perform operations on digital signals.
	- In binary logic circuits, there are only two values: 0 and 1.
	- The general form of a logic circuit is a switching network:
		- Essentially, we just map $\left\{x_1,x_2,x_3,...x_n\right\}$ to $\left\{y_1,y_2,y_3,...y_n\right\}$.
	- Switching functions:
		- Take an input, produce an output.
		- We can describe one of these with:
			- VHDL
				- Virtual Hardware Description Language
				- Used to describe combinational and sequential logic circuits.
			- Truth Tables
				- List each combination of inputs and show the resulting output.
				- Pretty easy, but very tedious.
			- Boolean Expressions
				- Showing AND, OR, and NOT as algebraic expressions.
					- "A and B": $A\cdot B$
					- "A or B": $A+B$
					- "not A": $\overline{A}$
			- Circuit Diagrams
				- Lil' picture you draw of the circuit.
			- Timing Diagrams
				- A graph that shows values over time.
		- Each of those methods can be used to create the others.
	- Next week we start on Boolean Algebra!

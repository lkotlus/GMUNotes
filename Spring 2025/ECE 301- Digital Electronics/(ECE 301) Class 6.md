### SoP and PoS
- It's so easy, why are we still doing it?
- The cost of a circuit is the sum of all our gates and the number of inputs to the gates. Inverters count as gates!
- SoP expressions are implemented as AND-OR circuits. There's a line of AND gates that all go into an OR gate.
- PoS expressions are implemented as OR-AND circuits. There's a line of OR gates that all go into an AND gate.
- We can turn SoP expressions into NAND-NAND circuits.
	- An OR gate with inversion on every input is the same as a NAND gate.
	- We need to convert **everything** to NAND. Even inverters. 
- We can turn PoS expressions into NOR-NOR circuits.
	- An AND gate with inversion on every input is the same as a NOR gate.
	- Same rules as NAND-NAND.
- It's actually more effective to do everything in NAND and NOR.

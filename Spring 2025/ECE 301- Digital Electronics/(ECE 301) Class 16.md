### Multiplexers
- A multiplexer (MUX) circuit has:
	- $n$ control inputs (determines output)
	- $2^n$ data inputs (choices for output)
	- One output
- It passes the signal value on one of its data inputs to its output based on the value(s) of the select signal(s).
- This is how networking devices MUX and DEMUX. Circuits!
	- Because of this, MUX circuits are everywhere.
- 2-to-1 MUX:
	- $Z=\overline{A}\cdot I_0 + A\cdot I_1$
	- I think it will always be $Z=\sum m_n \cdot I_n$
- The preferred implementation of a MUX is with transmission gates rather than with AND gates. 
- We can use MUXs to synthesize logic functions. I'm not sure *why* we'd do this, but it's neat.
	- We use this concept by just creating lookup tables with MUX circuits. This is how we access memory.
	- Doing something like just an XOR gate with a MUX is very inefficient, but doing it to solve actual problems is very useful.

### Variables and Functions
- OR
	- Parallel switches simulate an OR gate.
- AND
	- Switches in series simulate an AND gate.
- NOT
	- If you have a low resistance route to ground, then when the switch is open current will flow through it. 
	- This is a short circuit! The energy is shorted directly to ground!
	- If the switch is closed, current will go to through the other route. 
	- Current takes the path of least resistance.
- NAND
	- NOT AND
	- Invert after the AND. That's the whole thing.
- NOR
	- NOT OR
- XOR
	- Exclusive OR
	- Odd number of 1's inputted. For two inputs, it's a single 1 input, making it exclusive.
- XNOR
	- Inverted XOR
- Functionally complete set:
	- A functionally complete set contains all logic operations needed to implement any logic function.
	- Any logic set can be completed using NOT, AND, and OR.
		- $\left\{\text{NOT}, \text{AND}, \text{OR}\right\}$ is a functionally complete set.

### Logic Gates and Networks
- We put gates together into networks. Very epic.
- We can create boolean algebra expressions from these diagrams.

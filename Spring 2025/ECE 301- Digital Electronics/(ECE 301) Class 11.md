### Continuing with Minimization
- We don't want costly circuits, now do we?
- We're trying to make the most efficient circuits possible. Sick.
- Not sure why we're still on this. Going into some don't care condition stuff now. Taking us nearly three weeks to catch up to homework 3. Crazy.
- We can merge multiple functions into a single circuit that is more cost-effective with K-maps. This results in a less efficient circuit for each individual function, but a more efficient circuit for all of them combined by being able to reuse gates.
- When converting from POS to NOR only or SOP to NAND only, we are really just doing a bunch of DeMorgan's theorem stuff.
- NOR and NAND gates require less transistors than AND, OR, and NOT gates, so it's far more efficient to just convert everything.

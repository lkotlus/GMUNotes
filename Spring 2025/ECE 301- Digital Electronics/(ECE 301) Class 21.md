### Flip-flops
- Master-Slave D Flip-Flop:
	- So we have two gated D latches
		- The first, master, changes its state while clock is 1
		- The second, slave, changes its state while clock is 0
	- $Q$ becomes $D$ whenever $Clk$ is 1
- Positive edge:
	- $Q$ becomes $D$ when $Clk$ becomes 1
- Negative edge:
	- $Q$ becomes $D$ when $Clk$ becomes 0
- Edge-Triggered Flip-Flop is similar in functionality, and we can implement it with 6 NAND gates.
	- Negative edge triggered D flip-flop is the same, but we use NOR gates.
- Clear and Preset inputs:
	- Sometimes we want to set $Q=1$ and $Q=0$. 
	- We use preset and clear (respectively) for this.
	- These inputs are asynchronous to the clock.
	- Active-low preset forces $Q$ to 1
	- Active-low clear forces $Q$ to 0
- We can program an enable input by using a 2-1 MUX. We essentially just send the MUX into $D$, and $D$ is the 1-output of the 2-1 MUX. Very neat.
- T Flip-Flop:
	- Just another FF type. We can derive it from a basic D FF.
	- The name T is from the behavior of the circuit, which "toggles" its state when $T=1$. 
		- This is useful for counter circuits
	- Essentially, if $T=1$ on the target edge of the clock, $Q(t+1)=\overline{Q(t)}$.
	- We have positive and negative edge triggers for this as well.
- The main focus here seems to be figuring out what type of FF we have based on a time diagram.
- JK Flip-Flop:
	- This is derived from the basic D FF such that $D=J\overline{Q}+\overline{K}Q$. 
	- Combines the $SR$ and the $T$ FF:
		- Behaves like $SR$ for all values except $J=K=1$
		- When $J=K=1$, we have a $T$ FF
		- $J=1$ resets to $Q=1$
		- $K=1$ resets to $Q=0$

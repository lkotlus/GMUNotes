### More Design Examples
- 3-bit down counter with T flip flops
	- Cool, so start with a state diagram
	- Next get your tables
	- Construct some K-maps
- Mod 6 up counter:
	- Make you state diagram:
		- 000 -> 001 -> 010 -> 011 -> 100 -> 101 -> 000 -> ...
	- Just count all possible values for a mod 6 operation
	- Same process as the other ones. Just go through and practice these, it isn't terribly difficult.

### Final Exam
- This is the last class session!
- The final is cumulative, there will be around 20 problems. All multiple choice.
- We're still using lock down browser.
- We get 2.5 hours to take it.
	- That's 7.8 minutes per problem.
- Make sure to know:
	- Types of logic gates and how they work
		- AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOT
	- Synthesizing expressions
	- Truth tables, timing diagrams, K-maps
	- Draw something if you're given an equation
	- Boolean Algebra
	- CMOS circuits
	- Tri-state buffers, MUX, FFs, latches
		- Know how to implement $D$ latches and FFs using NAND and NOR!
	- Differences between types of flip flops
		- $JK$, $D$, $T$, and all of their variants
	- Designing with FFs
		- Making registers and counters
		- Going through the whole process, including the state diagram
	- The example last week with the $JK$ flip flop timing diagram. ***Practice that problem.***
	- 1's complement, 2's complement, signed numbers, etc.
	- Shannon's expansion theorem for MUX
	- 3-level circuits from either POS or SOP
	- Arithmetic circuits, RCA and CLA

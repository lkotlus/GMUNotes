### Finishing Supply and Demand
- Supply and demand ultimately results in the idea that prices are not arbitrary. It's determined by the logic of market forces.
- Finishing with minimum wage:
	- The long held consensus was that minimum wage (a price floor) causes a surplus of labor.
	- It almost always hurts the people who need the minimum wage jobs most.
	- The Fair Labor Act was actually not lobbied for by low wage workers, it was mainly backed by owners of textile mills in the US northeast.
	- Rich capitalists in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts wanted this. They had mills that turned cotton/linen into thread, then to cloth, and finally to clothing.
	- These people learned that they started losing market share because of textile mills in the south. The mills in the north benefited from early industrialization due to the removal of slavery. Later on, the south finally started to industrialize
	- The northerners started to ask why the southern mills were doing better. They realized that the southern mills paid their workers 15 cents an hour. To get rid of this advantage, they lobbied for a minimum wage of 25 cents an hour.
	- The Otis Elevator Company did the same thing. They had a patent on automatic elevators and wanted people to not be able to afford elevator operators.
- The market somehow works, which is crazy. 
- We've mainly been looking at consumer demand, but realize that it also works as being producers. Producers have demand for labor, shipping crates, insurance, etc.
- Derived Demand is a result of people wanting to produce something, and therefore needing more resources as a result.
	- As consumer demand for apples goes, up producers of apples goes up, and so demand of crates, orchards, etc. go up.
	- The demand for the things that producers buy is derived from the things that consumers want.
- Some goods are legal to give away but not legal to sell. They have a price ceiling at 0.
	- Kidneys can't be sold, but they can be given away. This creates a higher demand than there is supply.

### International Trade
- Different from intranational trade (state to state, within state, etc.).
- The final conclusion made by Adam Smith i that there is nothing economically special about political borders.
- We live in a world of 200 countries, but we'll just work with 3 in class.
- Adam smith was very interested in international trade.
- He called the ideas of his time on the topic the "mercantile system". In the modern day we call it mercantilism. Wealth of Nations is a violent attack against mercantilism.
- The debate of everything is free trade vs. mercantilism
- Mercantalists believe:
	1. Wealth is zero sum (fixed amount of wealth in the world)
	2. Therefore trade is zero sum
	3. Wealth is money
	4. Imports are bad
	5. Exports are good
- Most people making the mercantilist works were officials in government
- They weren't opposed to trade, they just thought it should be controlled by the government.

### Demand and whatnot
- So recall that elasticity is not the slope of the demand curve, but is somewhat similar. 
- $\mathcal{E}_D=\frac{\Delta Q_d\%}{\Delta P\%}$
	- Elasticity of demand is the percent change in quantity demanded over the percent change in price.
- Law of demand tells us the direction of change in quantity demanded due to change in price, but not the magnitude of change. Elasticity gives us that magnitude.
- <u>Elasticity is NOT the slope!</u> It's similar, but different. Discussed further later.
	- (Logan theory: this is because we are looking at percent changes)
- We start off at a price 100, which has a quantity demanded of 1. We will decrease the price by 1, going to 99, which makes quantity demanded 2. Using our equation: $\mathcal{E}_D=\frac{100\%}{1\%}=\frac{100}{1}$. So our slope is -1, but our elasticity of demand is $\frac{100}{1}$. That's elastic.
- Let's go to when price is 2 and goes to 1. That's a 100% change in price and a 1% change in quantity demanded. That means that we now have an elasticity of $\frac{1}{100}$! We're inelastic now.
- So elasticity changes over all intervals, and it's precisely because of the percentage. Logan theory is very correct.
- For any straight line demand curve, the elasticity is always higher at higher prices.
- There are three factors for elasticity that we take into account. We can see what determines the elasticity of a demand curve.
	1. Percentage of the buyers budget spent on the good. The greater is the percentage, the more elastic is the demand. This makes sense, if a large portion of my budget is for something, I'm more sensitive to the price.
	2. Number of available substitutes. The more substitutes, the more elastic the demand. This makes sense as well. I like Coke and Pepsi, so if Coke Zero is on a massive sale, I load up on that instead of getting Pepsi at all.
	3. Time. The longer time that buyers have to adjust to a price change, the more elastic is the demand. This is a subcategory of the previous one, it changes because I can find more substitutes with that time. If I have 30 seconds to choose what I'm getting at the grocery store, I'm getting the thing I know. If I have 10 minutes, I'll search the shelves.
- So that's the theory of consumer behavior. Very cool!

### Switching over to supply
- Where do prices come from?
- So legally, when I buy something the only thing that happens is transferal of ownership rights.
- When I agree to work for someone, I'm exchanging my ability to control my time in exchange for money. My time and actions are being purchased. Everything is an exchange of property rights.
- Anyone who owns anything (with a handful of exceptions) that can legally be bought and sold is a potential seller of those things.
- Supply, however, is sticking to those who posses something not as a seller, but as a consumer. Most homeowners are not trying to sell their house. The housing supply is about those who produce/sell housing.
- Our supply curve is a line sloping upward to the right. It's also in the plot of price vs. quantity per unit time. For any given price, we have a quantity supplied.
- The higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. The lower the price, the lower the quantity supplied.
- A supply curve shifted to the right shows a higher supply. The left, lower supply. Always think of both demand and supply curves in a horizontal dimension.
- Supply curve really represents cost of production. 
- Economists call "normal profit", the thing that entices someone to own a production firm. It's the amount that owners of a firm must have left over for themselves to compensate for them being owners of the firm. It's a cost.
- Residual claimant is the person who takes whatever is left over after business costs are paid. That's really just the owners. The residuals are their payment.
- The thing that causes a supply curve to change is a change in cost of producing any given quantity. If cost of production falls, supply increases. If cost of production rises, supply falls.

### Price
- The law of "one" price
	- Because of equilibrium prices go to one (approximate) price that everyone benefits from
	- If milk costed an insane amount, nobody would buy it. Buyers can't conspire because it is illegal, but it has happened before.
	- The truth is that market forces cause the one price.
- Arbitrage and Speculation:
	- Arbitrage: buying low and selling high (through space)
	- Speculation: buying low and selling high (through time)
- Arbitrage assists with the law of one price. It drives high prices down, but it also drives low prices up because of increased demand.
- People with low prices hate it, but people with high prices usually love it.
- Saving can be a form of arbitrage as well. Rather than travelling a particular distance, you travel forward in time. If I perceive that there will be a famine, I save food. If I perceive that the market will go up, I save stocks.

### Price Floors/Ceilings (Price Control)
- Ceilings are prices capped below equilibrium, floors are prices capped above equilibrium.
- Main effects of ceilings:
	- Shortages
	- Requires a mechanism to determine who gets the good and who doesn't
	- Lines to get the good
	- Corruption
	- Decrease in quality
	- Increase in marginal value of each unit
- Energy price ceilings:
	- Nixon did it, people would go in lines to buy gas.
	- There was a cap on monetary exchange, but people would bribe gas stations, get up early, etc. in order to pay more via non-monetary prices.
- Rent control price ceilings:
	- Massive disaster
	- Hurt the tenants and the landlords
	- Drove up demand for NJ and Long Island places as they are substitute goods
	- Landlords would burn their buildings for insurance money rather than losing money for just owning property
- Effects of price floors:
	- Surplus of the good
	- Rationing of buyers
	- Buyers get less of the good
	- Decrease in marginal value/market value of the good
	- Bribery of buyers to purchase the good
	- Increase in quality of the good
- Civil Aeronautics Board:
	- Plane tickets had a price floor
	- It became a very expensive and deluxe thing to do, even in coach
	- Quality went up as a result of the price floor
	- The price floor went away, and now quality is back down
- Minimum wage
	- Is also a price floor!
	- Set in place by the Fair Labor Act in 1938
	- Currently $7.25/hr
	- If price of labor is low, people purchase tons of laborers. In Guatemala people have dish washers and servants even if they're just middle class
	- Majority of minimum wage workers are very young
	- Only 2% of people live on federal minimum wage
	- The percentage that gets federal or non-federal minimum wage is 5%. 95% of the work force makes more than state minimum wage.
	- Wages are bid up as a result of worker productivity. Minimum wage creates a surplus of workers. Higher minimum wage leads to more unemployment
- Sowell and minimum wage:
	- 1948:
		- Unemployment rate for black teenagers had lower rate (9.8) than white teenagers (10.4)
	- Over time:
		- White teenager rate has stayed the same, but unemployment for black teenagers has tripled.
	- White teenagers are more qualified for jobs, but as minimum wage has increased, unemployment has increased as well.
- Empirical studies such as the one from President Carter show:
	- 10% increase in minimum wage causes a 1% increase in the unemployment rate among low-wage workers
- This has been challenged by David Card and Allen Kruger (Card and Kruger)
- Some side with Card and Kruger (~30% of economists), but the majority (~70%) remain convince that minimum wage leads to unemployment.
- Before Card and Kruger there was huge consensus among economists.
- Minimum wage has been abused by people
	- Rich capitalists in Pennsylvania lobbied for it to make it so Southern textile factories went out of business because they couldn't afford to pay their workers
	- Otis Elevator Company did the same thing to prevent elevator operators from existing. That way everyone would choose to buy an automatic elevator instead.
- Derived Demand is a result of people wanting to produce something, and therefore needing more resources as a result.
- Some goods are legal to give but illegal to sell, that's a price ceiling at 0 (such as kidneys)

### International Trade
- Adam Smith says that there's nothing economically special about political borders
- Adam Smith fought the mercantile system (mercantilism) in favor of free trade
- Mercantilist beliefs:
	1. Wealth is zero sum
	2. Therefore trade is zero sum
	3. Wealth is money
	4. Imports are bad
	5. Exports are good
	6. Governments should conduct trade policy to increase exports and decrease imports
- Most people making the mercantilist works were officials in government. They weren't opposed to trade, but they did want the government to control it.
- Beggar-thy-neighbor is the mercantilist mantra.
- Free trade:
	- Free as in freedom
	- Country practices free trade insofar as the people of the country are free to spend their income as they wish regardless of where the goods come from
	- Foreign goods still need to meet legal and quality standards.
- Mercantilism (protectionism):
	- Government restricts the purchase of foreign goods, typically by taxes (tariffs)
- Tariffs:
	- Revenue:
		- Designed not to keep goods out of the country, but to make money.
		- Sort of like sales tax.
		- George Washington's first ever executive order was a revenue tariff, it is invalid to use this as an argument for protectionism.
	- Protection:
		- Actual trade policy, used to stop foreign trade.
		- Because of the nature of substitute goods, people will buy the artificially cheaper goods made in their home country.
- Politicians love tariffs
- Free trade is the best! It helps everyone!!!
	- Money we spend always comes back via either investment or goods.
	- We trade by comparative advantage. If we purchase 1 million dollars worth of steel and a foreign country purchases 1 million dollars worth of lumber, we both made a profit!
		- By comparable advantage, to make a profit I could sell 800 thousand worth of lumber for 1 million. But that lumber might cost 1.2 million for the foreigner to produce!
		- In the exact same way, it would cost more for us to make steel, but we got it for cheaper and they made a profit.
		- Everyone came out richer!
	- Jobs are lost in areas that we are worse at, but jobs are made in areas where we have a comparable advantage. Net jobs remain the same!
	- Tariffs protect inefficient industries.
	- We still produce things, and we produce more things than ever. We just have a lower share of workers in manufacturing.
		- This isn't a problem, we're just more efficient!
	- US income (adjusted for inflation) is still higher
	- We haven't become poorer from foreign trade!
- Learner Equivalence theorem:
	- Adam Smith knew this, but it was named after Albert Learner
	- Learner mathematically proved Smith's theory.
	- Trade deficits are created by foreign countries investing rather than purchasing our exports.
	- ***All trade ends up balanced when you include investments.***
- Things you can do with money:
	1. Spend
	2. Equity investment
		- Ownership investment is to have equity
		- Active (I have majority of shares) and passive (I have some shares)
	3. Debt investment
		- Lending others money and charging interest
	4. Real-estate investment
		- Buy property. Land and all permanent structures on the land.
	5. Cash investment
		- Saying that another countries currency will hold better than your own.
		- These dollars eventually come back.
		- Even if they don't, someone not spending is the best-case scenario! If someone doesn't spend that money and it is just destroyed, then we essentially got the goods just for the price of printing the money.
			- Real-cash-balance effect
- America has been in a trade deficit since the seventies, it has only made us richer.
- Accounts:
	- Current Account:
		- Monetary imports and exports.
		- Current account surplus means we export more than import.
		- Current account deficit means we import more than export
	- Capital Account:
		- Investments
		- Capital account surplus means people invest in us more than we invest in them
		- Capital account deficit means we invest in others more than they invest in us
- Bilateral trade deficits/surpluses are essentially made up by politicians, you need to look at your global trade deficits/surpluses. 
- Assuming three countries, China, US, and Brazil:
	- US purchases 1 million in steel from China
	- China purchases 1 million in coffee from Brazil
	- Brazil purchases 1 million in lumber from US
- ***Everybody*** has a bilateral trade deficit
- ***Nobody*** has a trade deficit with the whole world
- There is no reason to assume that two countries will ever have balanced trade with one another
	- That's like saying that you want fully balanced trade with your supermarket. You would need to be employed by them and spend all your money there.
	- I am in a bilateral trade deficit with everyone I've ever bought something from, and a bilateral trade surplus with everyone I've ever been employed by
- Our lack of exports in goods is made up for by the gigantic amount of services we provide. 80% of the US exports are services, we have a service sector economy.
	- As you become wealthier, you want to get more services than goods. You want to go on vacation, go to the store, get a massage, etc. 
- National security exemption for trade.
- Free trade promotes peace and disincentivizes wars. The more you trade, the less you raid.
- Doux commerce Theorem:
	- Theorem that shows that if we're more economically integrated, we're economically dependent. 
	- Economic dependency implies that we are either customers or suppliers. You don't shoot your customers, and you don't bite the hand that feeds you.
- Decreasing tariffs increases free trade, and therefore decreases wars and violence. Tariffs increased tensions in WW2!

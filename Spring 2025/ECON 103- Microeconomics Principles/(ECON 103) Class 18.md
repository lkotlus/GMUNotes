### International Trade
- Mercantilism
	- Adam Smith smashed it and destroyed it, but people still have it as the most common view.
	- President Trump, Biden, etc. all have this view.
- The idea is that whenever you trade somebody loses. This must be false by comparative advantage. We can both win.
- The beliefs of a mercantilist:
	1. Wealth is zero sum (fixed amount of wealth in the world)
	2. Therefore trade is zero sum
	3. Wealth is money
	4. Imports are bad
	5. Exports are good
	6. ***Governments*** should conduct trade policy to increase exports and decrease imports
- The general worry is that we will be "ripped off" by imports. Government should therefore control trade to prevent imports and encourage exports.
- The term used by mercantilists is "beggar-thy-neighbor". Essentially, make the other countries poorer so that you are richer due to taking more of the "limited" wealth.
- So why do the vast majority of economists believe that the mercantilists were wrong? How did Adam Smith prove it?
- It's a battle between the free traders and the mercantilists (or the protectionists).
- Free trade:
	- Doesn't mean trade doesn't cost anything
	- Free as in freedom
	- A country practices free trade insofar as the people of the country are free to spend their income as they wish regardless of where the goods come from.
	- This doesn't mean that things made abroad don't need to meet the same legal and quality standards as the country. Free trade still states that cars made in Japan need to meet US standards for automobiles.
- Mercantilism (protectionism):
	- Mercantilism and protectionism are almost synonymous. Protectionism as a term comes from the idea of "protecting" the local economy from foreigners.
	- The government restricts the purchase of foreign goods, typically by taxes. 
	- Taxes that discourage people in a country from buying foreign goods are called tariffs.
	- Export taxes exist, but they're rare and we won't talk about them. They don't matter on a practical level.
- Tariffs:
	- Revenue:
		- Designed not to keep goods out of the country
		- Designed to increase revenue, just like a sales tax
		- For a revenue tariff, they hope it won't discourage you. They want you to pay more money to them.
		- The majority of US revenue for a long time was on taxing imports, mainly because it was more convenient. The first thing President George Washington signed was an import tariff, but not a protective one.
		- We won't talk about these, we have income tax now and barely make any money on tariffs.
		- You can't argue that tariffs are good because it was the first thing George Washington put in place, that was a revenue tariff. Those are completely different. 
	- Protection:
		- These are actual trade policy.
		- They still raise revenue, but that isn't their goal. The goal is to increase the price of foreign made goods.
		- Because of how substitute goods work, that makes US substitute goods more attractive. We artificially increase demand for ourselves.
- Most presidents loved tariffs on all ends of the aisle. Most people are mercantilists.
- If your goal is to have ordinary people in the country enjoy living standards as high as possible and have economic growth as fast as possible, then is protection or free trade better?
	- We will answer this question.
	- This will be done by discussing the three most common objections to free trade:
		1. "Free trade reduces employment and destroys jobs."
		2. "Free trade is unbalanced."
		3. "Free trade (especially with a poor country) lowers wage rates."
	- We will spend most of our time addressing these. 
- Working through it:
	- We live in a world of nearly 200 countries. We'll just assume there's 2 countries. The US and China. Let's make some assumptions:
		- Nobody in China has ill-will towards someone in the US
		- Nobody in China wants any goods from the US
	- With those assumptions, how many goods will China send to the US? None! If they don't want anything from us, then what could we possibly ever give to them?
	- We do, however, see ships going from China to the US. Because of this, we know that assumption 2 is wrong.
	- China accepts USD for goods and services (all international trade is in USD, no matter what country, by the way), and they only accept USD because it gives them purchasing power. Let's say we send a total of 1 million USD.
	- All of this was in voluntary transactions. We wanted the goods, they wanted the 1 million USD.
	- Foreigners like USD for the same reason as us: they can spend them or invest them.
	- Let's assume that the stuff they send us is steel. 
	- If I'm a steel working in Pennsylvania, I don't really like this. Americans are buying foreign-made steel and my market share goes down. This is true, the steel workers are correct.
	- Some US steel mills shut down, some workers lose their jobs, stock prices fall. This happens.
		- Protectionists stop there and don't look at it any further.
		- Let's look at the full effects.
	- Well China accepts dollars so that they can spend them. We'll say that the person selling steel in China, Mr. Peng, needs lumber to build his dream house. He'll send the 1 million USD right back to the US to get the lumber if the price for our goods is better. This is the simplest possible depiction.
	- Lumber workers love this, and they're going to hire more workers. Because of this, the people who used to work in the steel mills now work in lumber.
	- From this, we can learn that trade does destroy particular jobs, but it creates jobs in other areas.
	- Data shows that trade policy has no effect on employment. Trade does, however, shift employment. Nobody is saying that the exact same people from the steel mill go to the lumber mill. But the total amount of employment in the country stays the same. It just determines where the jobs are in the country.
	- An economist will notice that China has a comparative advantage in steel and the US has a comparative advantage in lumber.
	- We specialize in what we have a comparative advantage in as individuals, the same goes for countries. The country will specialize in the goods that it produces best.
	- It's important to keep in mind that the countries don't trade. People in the countries trade. If "the US trades 1 million USD for steel from China", then it was really "people in the US bought 1 million USD of steel from people producing steel in China".
	- Trade moves resources within a country from the industries with a comparative disadvantage to the industries with a comparative advantage.
	- Tariffs are not taxes on steel, they are taxes on me.
	- If Americans don't get the steel, they don't send the USD to China. If that doesn't go to China, China doesn't buy the US lumber. Then the lumber mills lose money and our lumber workers lose their jobs instead. 
	- Tariffs protect jobs in protected industries, and they destroy jobs in ones that are not protected. 
	- If Mr. Peng chooses to use his money in China, then he converts it to Yuan. The Chinese banker that does this gives Mr. Peng the equivalent amount in USD in exchange for Mr. Peng's money. 
		- The banker must do this because he or one of his clients wants to spend money on things from the US.
	- The USD must make its way back. As workers go into more efficient industries, all countries become more efficient. As this happens, the global economy becomes more efficient. 
	- Now let's say that China only buys 600 thousand USD in lumber. The impact on the lumber industry doesn't fully counteract the steel jobs anymore. 
		- Well why did China send a million in steel if they only wanted 600 thousand in lumber?
		- What are they doing the remaining 400 thousand? They're investing/saving!
		- We invest dollars in the US! This just further helps with US jobs in other industries.
		- When this happens, we call it a trade deficit.
		- This occurs whenever a country imports more goods and services than it exports over a particular period of time. 
	- No matter what, net employment is going to remain the same.

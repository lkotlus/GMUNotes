### Finishing Up Mercantilism Vs. Free Trade
- So tariffs lower the stock market for obvious reasons, trade is decreased.
- Allowing free trade might destroy jobs in fields where we have a comparative disadvantage, but it creates jobs where we have a comparative advantage. Net jobs stay the same. 
	- Tariffs destroy efficient jobs and create inefficient jobs.
- Imports and exports move in the same direction.
- The Learner Equivalence theorem:
	- Adam Smith knew this, but it was named after Albert Learner.
	- Learner proved Adam Smith's knowledge of this with math, pretty neat!
	- Trade deficits (current account deficit) is created by foreign countries investing rather than purchasing our exports.
	- All trade ends up balanced when you include investments. Our capital account surplus increases when your trade deficit increases. It's not a scary thing.
- Five (good) things that anyone can do with their money (2-5 are classified as investments):
	1. Spend it
	2. Equity investment
		- Ownership investment, to have equity in a company
		- Both active and passive.
	3. Debt
		- Lending someone else money (charge interest!)
	4. Real-estate purchases
		- Buy property
		- Land and all permanent structures on the land
	5. Cash
		- When foreigners hold cash, they are investing in America
		- Essentially they are saying that our currency will be more valuable than theirs.
		- These dollars come back to America because as time goes on they eventually trade it back to us.
		- Even if the cash is completely lost, the purchasing power returns
		- Important application of a concept called real-cash-balance effect:
			- This is kind of a fancy term, but it's an important concept in economics. The real-cash-balance effect.
			- It essentially says that the value of a piece of money (the purchasing power) is determined by how many goods and services are in the economy. 
				- The greater the amount of goods and services available, the greater is the purchasing power of the money.
			- If 30 trillion dollars are literally destroyed by a foreigner (dropped in a backpack into a volcano), what happens? 
			- Well, they kept selling things to us. There's more goods and services in the US!
			- The moment that the money is destroyed, the foreigner cannot purchase any of the things he once could, but I can purchase them!
			- Essentially, the demand for the goods falls because of the loss of money. Purchasing power of my dollars goes up because of that.
			- The best-case scenario is for people to take our money and never spend it here.
- America has been in a trade deficit since the seventies. It hasn't made us poorer, it's made us richer as a result of foreign investment.
- Exam on Thursday!

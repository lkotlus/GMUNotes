### Second online thing for this class.
- Kind of silly of him to make us do all of this. Just take the L if it was your mistake. Furthermore, he didn't even give things to us on the same times as class.

### Economics as a science
- Prof thinks that this is a science. 
- Most say that science is based on predictions, but Biology is explanatory.
- In that same way, economics is explanatory. You can attempt to use it for predictions, but that is rather unwise. Economics is a quest for understanding, and that's science.
- Economics must be a positive discipline, meaning objective. Economics is concerned with correct and incorrect. I like this about economics.
- Economics also confines itself to the way the world works rather than the way the world ought to work. I like this about economics too.
- Normative statements are based on values. Economics does not deal with normative statements.
- We will always be told when we are being given opinionated information in this course.
- It's up to us to figure out if we think that economic theory is a good theory.
- Fallacies that come up in economics:
	- Ad Hominem: personal attack rather than logic
	- Post Hoc: just because events occur in series doesn't mean that they cause one another
	- Composition: that which is true for an individual in a group does not make it true for the group
	- There's some others, but I think that this "lecture" doesn't actually matter.

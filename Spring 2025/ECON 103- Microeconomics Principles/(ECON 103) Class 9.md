### Supply
- This is pivotal to economic theory.
- Last week we learned about the law of diminishing marginal utility.
	- The more we consume of something, the less utility (satisfaction) we get from it.
	- Scarcity creates higher enjoyment of a single unit of something. 
	- As access increases, the additional utility from an additional unit decreases.
- We can take our marginal utility curve and get supply from it. Change the y-axis from "marginal utility" to "price".
- The price we are talking about is per unit. X-axis is still just quantity.
- We have a simplifying assumption to start. When you buy something, the price we pay in money is the major consideration. 
- We want to draw a line that shows the relationship between the price of the good in question (apples) and the **<u>quantity demanded</u>** of that good or service.
	- It's a straight line with a negative slope. This makes sense, nobody wants to buy something if it's crazy expensive.
	- "Demand" is just the quantity that someone wants to buy.
	- We call this line the demand curve, and I can just think of it as my demand for some good or service.
- We aren't looking at price and demand, we're looking at price and quantity demanded. 
- This is just the law of marginal utility, the buyer is willing to pay more due to scarcity.
- **<u>We will be tested on demand vs. quantity demanded.</u>**
	- Quantity demanded is a single point
	- Demand is the entire curve
	- A change in price of apples will change the quantity demanded for apples, but not the demand for apples.
- A condition, or determinant of demand, is anything that moves demand other than price.
	- Tastes/preferences
	- Consumer income
	- Information
	- Price of related goods
		- Substitutes: as price for one changes, demand for the other changes in the same direction as the price change. Coke and Pepsi.
		- Complements: as price for one changes, the demand for the other changes in the opposite direction as the price change. Coffee and Styrofoam cups.
	- Expectation of future availability
- A movement of the curve out or in is a change in demand. Outward is increase of demand, inward is decrease in demand.

### Recall
- Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
- Law of demand
- We are exploring the theory of consumer behavior.
- Things that effect the demand curve:
	- Tastes/preferences
	- Consumer income
	- Information
	- Price of related goods
- **<u>Price never changes demand, it changes quantity demanded.</u>**
- There is a fifth determinant of demand:
	- Expectation of future availability
- A sixth as well, but it only applies to a market demand curve:
	- (A market demand curve is the summation of all demand curves in the market)
	- The more people in the market, the higher the demand. Fewer people, lower demand.
- The six determinants of demand (in order):
	1. Tastes/preferences
	2. Consumer income
	3. Information
	4. Price of related goods
	5. Expectation of future availability
	6. Market size (only for market demand, not individual demand)
- When we analyze individual or market demand curves, we are holding these determinants constant. We know how the curves can be shifted left and right, but what is it that changes the slope?
- Elasticity. The own-price elasticity of demand. Or, just the elasticity of demand.
- Elastic here, meaning malleable, stretchy, snaps back, etc. It refers to the sensitivity of something to outside forces. 
- Elasticity of demand refers to how sensitive quantity demanded is to change of price. It's similar to slope, but **<u>IT IS NOT THE SLOPE</u>**.
- The single formula in the whole class: $\mathcal{E}_D=\frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}$.
- Elasticity of demand is percentage change in quantity demanded over the percentage change in price. We really only care if $\mathcal{E}_D$ is greater than or less than 1.
	- $\mathcal{E}_D>1$, "elastic"
	- $\mathcal{E}_D<1$, "inelastic"
	- $\mathcal{E}_D=1$, "unit elasticity", we don't need to worry about this
- This is actually quite important. Total revenue is $P\cdot Q$, just multiply price by quantity. <u>Revenue is not profit</u>. 
- If price and total revenue change in the same direction, demand is inelastic. If price and total revenue change in opposite directions, demand is elastic.

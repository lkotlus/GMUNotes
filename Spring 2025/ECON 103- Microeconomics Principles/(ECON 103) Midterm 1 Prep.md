### Things to work on
- Revenue/elasticity of demand
- Inferior goods
### Filled in
- What is economics all about?
	- We recently became a very wealthy society. Economics is the study of how that happens and how it works.
- Hockey stick.
	- It's the shape of both the graph of average wealth and population size.
- How did we get more wealthy?
	- Population
- Julian Simon
	- The ultimate resource
		- The ultimate resource is the human mind
		- More people means more innovation. That's why we have two hockey sticks.
- Malthusian Trap
	- If you have a good harvest, your population will increase by a little bit. Unfortunately, your above-average harvests will not last and your population will collapse.
- Adam Smith
	- Division of labor (specialization)
		- Specialization is very epic. The idea is that one person can output far more if they focus on one thing.
		- Specialization also allows for us to produce more and more goods.
		- Specialization is very very important.
- Ten Foundation Stones
	1. We live in a world of inescapably scarce resources.
	2. Scarcity implies choice, which implies cost
	3. Not all costs are expressed in terms of money, and ultimately all costs are non-monetary
	4. People prefer more to less, human wants are unlimited
	5. Individuals are rational and self-interested
	6. Individuals respond predictably to incentives
	7. Beware of unintended consequences
	8. Human motivation does not change when people change jobs
	9. Tastes and preferences are subjective
	10. Decisions are made at the margin
- David Ricardo
	- Principle of comparable advantage
		- Fish on an island
- Capital vs. Consumption Goods
	- Capital goods are tools
	- Consumption goods are things that you consume
- Money
	- Incentive for saving
		- If we save, then we can use excess to create capital goods
		- Savings allow for risk taking
	- Banks
		- Banks began as glorified safes, but eventually began to use the money they had to invest and give out loans, turning a profit.
		- Banks would give out notes instead of requiring you to withdraw your gold.
		- That's how currency started
	- Medium of exchange
		- Money is just a medium of exchange. We agree that a dollar is an abstract amount that is equivalent to certain things.
	- Fiat currency
		- A currency that is worth things simply on the grounds of it being backed by a lot of people. No actual value behind it, we just agree that it is worth.
	- Financial markets produce savings
		- That really says it all
	- Loans
		- Loans are not evil, they allow for innovation.
		- Interest is required to create profit and give insurance.
- Theory of Consumer Behavior
	- Production possibilities curve.
		- Plot the quantity produced of one good vs. another
	- Prices are not arbitrary
		- They can't be. In some way both producers and consumers choose them.
	- Term of exchange
		- Price is a term of exchange. It isn't necessarily money, and is ultimately non-monetary.
	- The law of diminishing marginal utility
		- I start of enjoying something, but the more I have of it the less I want
	- Maximize satisfaction
		- We are trying to get things that will maximize our utility.
	- Demand
		- How much people want something.
		- Plot quantity demanded vs. price
		- Negative slope
	- Demand vs. Quantity Demanded
		- Demand is the curve, quantity demanded is the value
	- Determinants of demand
		1. Tastes/preferences
		2. Consumer income
		3. Information
		4. Price of related goods
		5. Expectation of future availability
		6. Market size (only for market demand, not individual)
	- Outward and inward movement of the demand curve
		- Outward is higher demand, inward is less demand
	- Elasticity
		- Elasticity is not slope
		- $\mathcal{E}_D=\frac{\Delta\%Q}{\Delta\%P}$
		- Higher elasticity means demand is sensitive to price.
	- Revenue vs. Profit
		- Revenue is the total money resulting from selling everything produced. Price times quantity.
		- Profit is revenue subtracted by cost of production.
	- Determinants of elasticity
		1. Percentage of the buyers budget spent on the good.
		2. Number of available substitutes.
		3. Time to adjust to price change.
- Theory of Producer Behavior
	- How much of something do I make?
		- We want to make just the right amount of things.
	- Supply curve.
		- Plot quantity supplied vs. price
		- Positive slope
	- Supply curve movement
		- To the right is greater supply, to the left is lesser supply
	- Cost of production
		- It's essentially the only determinant of supply
	- Normal profit
		- Amount of profit left over for owners of a firm to justify them owning it. This is technically a cost of production.
	- Determinants of supply
		- It's all just cost of production
			1. Cost of inputs
			2. Production technology
			3. Development infrastructure
- Supply and Demand
	- Importance
		- Literally the most important concept in the whole course.
	- How to make the plot
		- Put the supply and demand curves on the same plot
	- Equilibrium price and quantity
		- Equilibrium price and quantity are the point at which the curves intersect
	- Prices surrounding equilibrium
		- Prices higher than equilibrium result in a lesser quantity demanded than supplied, which means that we have a surplus
		- Prices lower than equilibrium result in a higher quantity demanded than supplied, which means that we have a shortage
	- Surplus and shortage
		- See the above
- Theory of Price
	- Self-correcting market
		- The market pulls us to equilibrium price
	- Greed model vs. self-interest model
		- So the greed model states that prices rise out of greed.
		- In reality, prices rise because we want to buy things. I am willing to pay more to guarantee that I will get a product, so the prices are driven up by demand.
		- In the same way, prices are driven down by lack of demand. Suppliers make more money if they don't have excess product, and to sell more they want to be at equilibrium price.
	- Natural disaster
		- In a natural disaster, prices go up. Is this greed or self-interest?

### What is economics all about?
- We recently became a very wealthy society. Economics is the study of how that happens and how it works.
- Hockey stick.
	- It's the shape of both the graph of average wealth and population size.
- How did we get more wealthy?
	- Population
- Julian Simon
	- The ultimate resource
		- The ultimate resource is the human mind
		- More people means more innovation. That's why we have two hockey sticks.
- Malthusian Trap
	- If you have a good harvest, your population will increase by a little bit. Unfortunately, your above-average harvests will not last and your population will collapse.
- Adam Smith
	- Division of labor (specialization)
		- Specialization is very epic. The idea is that one person can output far more if they focus on one thing.
		- Specialization also allows for us to produce more and more goods.
		- Specialization is very very important.

### Ten Foundation Stones
- Here's what we've got:
	1. We live in a world of inescapably scarce resources.
	2. Scarcity implies choice, which implies cost
	3. Not all costs are expressed in terms of money, and ultimately all costs are non-monetary
	4. People prefer more to less, human wants are unlimited
	5. Individuals are rational and self-interested
	6. Individuals respond predictably to incentives
	7. Beware of unintended consequences
	8. Human motivation does not change when people change jobs
	9. Tastes and preferences are subjective
	10. Decisions are made at the margin
- David Ricardo
	- Principle of comparable advantage
		- Fish on an island
- Capital vs. Consumption Goods
	- Capital goods are tools
	- Consumption goods are things that you consume

### Money
- Incentive for saving
	- If we save, then we can use excess to create capital goods
	- Savings allow for risk taking
- Banks
	- Banks began as glorified safes, but eventually began to use the money they had to invest and give out loans, turning a profit.
	- Banks would give out notes instead of requiring you to withdraw your gold.
	- That's how currency started
- Medium of exchange
	- Money is just a medium of exchange. We agree that a dollar is an abstract amount that is equivalent to certain things.
- Fiat currency
	- A currency that is worth things simply on the grounds of it being backed by a lot of people. No actual value behind it, we just agree that it is worth.
- Financial markets produce savings
	- That really says it all
- Loans
	- Loans are not evil, they allow for innovation.
	- Interest is required to create profit and give insurance.

### Theory of Consumer Behavior
- Production possibilities curve.
	- Plot the quantity produced of one good vs. another
- Prices are not arbitrary
	- They can't be. In some way both producers and consumers choose them.
- Term of exchange
	- Price is a term of exchange. It isn't necessarily money, and is ultimately non-monetary.
- The law of diminishing marginal utility
	- I start of enjoying something, but the more I have of it the less I want
- Maximize satisfaction
	- We are trying to get things that will maximize our utility.
- Demand
	- How much people want something.
	- Plot quantity demanded vs. price
	- Negative slope
- Demand vs. Quantity Demanded
	- Demand is the curve, quantity demanded is the value
- Determinants of demand
	1. Tastes/preferences
	2. Consumer income
	3. Information
	4. Price of related goods
	5. Expectation of future availability
	6. Market size (only for market demand, not individual)
- Outward and inward movement of the demand curve
	- Outward is higher demand, inward is less demand
- Elasticity
	- Elasticity is not slope
	- $\mathcal{E}_D=\frac{\Delta\%Q}{\Delta\%P}$
	- Higher elasticity means demand is sensitive to price.
- Revenue vs. Profit
	- Revenue is the total money resulting from selling everything produced. Price times quantity.
	- Profit is revenue subtracted by cost of production.
- Determinants of elasticity
	1. Percentage of the buyers budget spent on the good.
	2. Number of available substitutes.
	3. Time to adjust to price change.

### Theory of Producer Behavior
- How much of something do I make?
	- We want to make just the right amount of things.
- Supply curve.
	- Plot quantity supplied vs. price
	- Positive slope
- Supply curve movement
	- To the right is greater supply, to the left is lesser supply
- Cost of production
	- It's essentially the only determinant of supply
- Normal profit
	- Amount of profit left over for owners of a firm to justify them owning it. This is technically a cost of production.
- Determinants of supply
	- It's all just cost of production
		1. Cost of inputs
		2. Production technology
		3. Development infrastructure

### Supply and Demand
- Importance
	- Literally the most important concept in the whole course.
- How to make the plot
	- Put the supply and demand curves on the same plot
- Equilibrium price and quantity
	- Equilibrium price and quantity are the point at which the curves intersect
- Prices surrounding equilibrium
	- Prices higher than equilibrium result in a lesser quantity demanded than supplied, which means that we have a surplus
	- Prices lower than equilibrium result in a higher quantity demanded than supplied, which means that we have a shortage
- Surplus and shortage
	- See the above

### Theory of Price
- Self-correcting market
	- The market pulls us to equilibrium price
- Greed model vs. self-interest model
	- So the greed model states that prices rise out of greed.
	- In reality, prices rise because we want to buy things. I am willing to pay more to guarantee that I will get a product, so the prices are driven up by demand.
	- In the same way, prices are driven down by lack of demand. Suppliers make more money if they don't have excess product, and to sell more they want to be at equilibrium price.
- Natural disaster
	- In a natural disaster, prices go up. Is this greed or self-interest? 

### Price
- The law of "one" price
	- Because of equilibrium prices go to one (approximate) price that everyone benefits from
	- If milk costed an insane amount, nobody would buy it. Buyers can't conspire because it is illegal, but it has happened before.
	- The truth is that market forces cause the one price.
- Arbitrage and Speculation:
	- Arbitrage: buying low and selling high (through space)
	- Speculation: buying low and selling high (through time)
- Arbitrage assists with the law of one price. It drives high prices down, but it also drives low prices up because of increased demand.
- People with low prices hate it, but people with high prices usually love it.
- Saving can be a form of arbitrage as well. Rather than travelling a particular distance, you travel forward in time. If I perceive that there will be a famine, I save food. If I perceive that the market will go up, I save stocks.

### Price Floors/Ceilings (Price Control)
- Ceilings are prices capped below equilibrium, floors are prices capped above equilibrium.
- Main effects of ceilings:
	- Shortages
	- Requires a mechanism to determine who gets the good and who doesn't
	- Lines to get the good
	- Corruption
	- Decrease in quality
	- Increase in marginal value of each unit
- Energy price ceilings:
	- Nixon did it, people would go in lines to buy gas.
	- There was a cap on monetary exchange, but people would bribe gas stations, get up early, etc. in order to pay more via non-monetary prices.
- Rent control price ceilings:
	- Massive disaster
	- Hurt the tenants and the landlords
	- Drove up demand for NJ and Long Island places as they are substitute goods
	- Landlords would burn their buildings for insurance money rather than losing money for just owning property
- Effects of price floors:
	- Surplus of the good
	- Rationing of buyers
	- Buyers get less of the good
	- Decrease in marginal value/market value of the good
	- Bribery of buyers to purchase the good
	- Increase in quality of the good
- Civil Aeronautics Board:
	- Plane tickets had a price floor
	- It became a very expensive and deluxe thing to do, even in coach
	- Quality went up as a result of the price floor
	- The price floor went away, and now quality is back down
- Minimum wage
	- Is also a price floor!
	- Set in place by the Fair Labor Act in 1938
	- Currently $7.25/hr
	- If price of labor is low, people purchase tons of laborers. In Guatemala people have dish washers and servants even if they're just middle class
	- Majority of minimum wage workers are very young
	- Only 2% of people live on federal minimum wage
	- The percentage that gets federal or non-federal minimum wage is 5%. 95% of the work force makes more than state minimum wage.
	- Wages are bid up as a result of worker productivity. Minimum wage creates a surplus of workers. Higher minimum wage leads to more unemployment
- Sowell and minimum wage:
	- 1948:
		- Unemployment rate for black teenagers had lower rate (9.8) than white teenagers (10.4)
	- Over time:
		- White teenager rate has stayed the same, but unemployment for black teenagers has tripled.
	- White teenagers are more qualified for jobs, but as minimum wage has increased, unemployment has increased as well.
- Empirical studies such as the one from President Carter show:
	- 10% increase in minimum wage causes a 1% increase in the unemployment rate among low-wage workers
- This has been challenged by David Card and Allen Kruger (Card and Kruger)
- Some side with Card and Kruger (~30% of economists), but the majority (~70%) remain convince that minimum wage leads to unemployment.
- Before Card and Kruger there was huge consensus among economists.
- Minimum wage has been abused by people
	- Rich capitalists in Pennsylvania lobbied for it to make it so Southern textile factories went out of business because they couldn't afford to pay their workers
	- Otis Elevator Company did the same thing to prevent elevator operators from existing. That way everyone would choose to buy an automatic elevator instead.
- Derived Demand is a result of people wanting to produce something, and therefore needing more resources as a result.
- Some goods are legal to give but illegal to sell, that's a price ceiling at 0 (such as kidneys)

### International Trade
- Adam Smith says that there's nothing economically special about political borders
- Adam Smith fought the mercantile system (mercantilism) in favor of free trade
- Mercantilist beliefs:
	1. Wealth is zero sum
	2. Therefore trade is zero sum
	3. Wealth is money
	4. Imports are bad
	5. Exports are good
	6. Governments should conduct trade policy to increase exports and decrease imports
- Most people making the mercantilist works were officials in government. They weren't opposed to trade, but they did want the government to control it.
- Beggar-thy-neighbor is the mercantilist mantra.
- Free trade:
	- Free as in freedom
	- Country practices free trade insofar as the people of the country are free to spend their income as they wish regardless of where the goods come from
	- Foreign goods still need to meet legal and quality standards.
- Mercantilism (protectionism):
	- Government restricts the purchase of foreign goods, typically by taxes (tariffs)
- Tariffs:
	- Revenue:
		- Designed not to keep goods out of the country, but to make money.
		- Sort of like sales tax.
		- George Washington's first ever executive order was a revenue tariff, it is invalid to use this as an argument for protectionism.
	- Protection:
		- Actual trade policy, used to stop foreign trade.
		- Because of the nature of substitute goods, people will buy the artificially cheaper goods made in their home country.
- Politicians love tariffs
- Free trade is the best! It helps everyone!!!
	- Money we spend always comes back via either investment or goods.
	- We trade by comparative advantage. If we purchase 1 million dollars worth of steel and a foreign country purchases 1 million dollars worth of lumber, we both made a profit!
		- By comparable advantage, to make a profit I could sell 800 thousand worth of lumber for 1 million. But that lumber might cost 1.2 million for the foreigner to produce!
		- In the exact same way, it would cost more for us to make steel, but we got it for cheaper and they made a profit.
		- Everyone came out richer!
	- Jobs are lost in areas that we are worse at, but jobs are made in areas where we have a comparable advantage. Net jobs remain the same!
	- Tariffs protect inefficient industries.
	- We still produce things, and we produce more things than ever. We just have a lower share of workers in manufacturing.
		- This isn't a problem, we're just more efficient!
	- US income (adjusted for inflation) is still higher
	- We haven't become poorer from foreign trade!
- Learner Equivalence theorem:
	- Adam Smith knew this, but it was named after Albert Learner
	- Learner mathematically proved Smith's theory.
	- Trade deficits are created by foreign countries investing rather than purchasing our exports.
	- ***All trade ends up balanced when you include investments.***
- Things you can do with money:
	1. Spend
	2. Equity investment
		- Ownership investment is to have equity
		- Active (I have majority of shares) and passive (I have some shares)
	3. Debt investment
		- Lending others money and charging interest
	4. Real-estate investment
		- Buy property. Land and all permanent structures on the land.
	5. Cash investment
		- Saying that another countries currency will hold better than your own.
		- These dollars eventually come back.
		- Even if they don't, someone not spending is the best-case scenario! If someone doesn't spend that money and it is just destroyed, then we essentially got the goods just for the price of printing the money.
			- Real-cash-balance effect
- America has been in a trade deficit since the seventies, it has only made us richer.
- Accounts:
	- Current Account:
		- Monetary imports and exports.
		- Current account surplus means we export more than import.
		- Current account deficit means we import more than export
	- Capital Account:
		- Investments
		- Capital account surplus means people invest in us more than we invest in them
		- Capital account deficit means we invest in others more than they invest in us
- Bilateral trade deficits/surpluses are essentially made up by politicians, you need to look at your global trade deficits/surpluses. 
- Assuming three countries, China, US, and Brazil:
	- US purchases 1 million in steel from China
	- China purchases 1 million in coffee from Brazil
	- Brazil purchases 1 million in lumber from US
- ***Everybody*** has a bilateral trade deficit
- ***Nobody*** has a trade deficit with the whole world
- There is no reason to assume that two countries will ever have balanced trade with one another
	- That's like saying that you want fully balanced trade with your supermarket. You would need to be employed by them and spend all your money there.
	- I am in a bilateral trade deficit with everyone I've ever bought something from, and a bilateral trade surplus with everyone I've ever been employed by
- Our lack of exports in goods is made up for by the gigantic amount of services we provide. 80% of the US exports are services, we have a service sector economy.
	- As you become wealthier, you want to get more services than goods. You want to go on vacation, go to the store, get a massage, etc. 
- National security exemption for trade.
- Free trade promotes peace and disincentivizes wars. The more you trade, the less you raid.
- Doux commerce Theorem:
	- Theorem that shows that if we're more economically integrated, we're economically dependent. 
	- Economic dependency implies that we are either customers or suppliers. You don't shoot your customers, and you don't bite the hand that feeds you.
- Decreasing tariffs increases free trade, and therefore decreases wars and violence. Tariffs increased tensions in WW2!

### Public Choice Economics
- Romantic View vs. Public Choice:
	- Romantic view: we suddenly become angels when we enter the public sector and care only for the greater good of everyone
	- Public choice is economics, we only act out of self interest
- Greatest hits:
	- James M. Buchanan: first GMU econ guy to get a Nobel Prize.
	- Gordon Tullock: also GMU, said that we should put daggers on the center of steering wheels. Worked with Buchanan, authored a book together called the Calculus of Consent. Never got a Nobel Prize.
- Buchanan and Tullock appreciated the constitutional convention. They believed that the founders, particularly James Madison, had a great understanding of free choice.
- Federalist #51: the government, men governing men, must be able to control the people. Furthermore, the government must be obliged to control itself.
- Voting isn't sufficient. If it were, we wouldn't need a constitution.
	- Arrow's impossibility theorem:
		- Named after Kenneth Arrow, the founder of Public Choice economics, much more of a mathematician though.
		- He showed that it is impossible to come up with any system of collective decision making that produces an outcome that shows only the preferences of the voters and is not polluted by arbitrary factors that should not play a role.
		- He was surprised to prove this!
		- Agenda Setters (people like Prime Ministers and the Speaker of the House) choose things like order of voting, influencing outcome.
		- There are exceptions to this theorem when we have a Condorcet Winner (vote that wins by majority).
		- Don't anthropomorphize groups of people!
- Special-Interest-Group Effect
	- When a small group (like sugar farmers) get big gain off small losses of a big group, they will fight harder than anyone in the large group to keep it.
- Rational Ignorance Effect
	- We don't research people because our vote doesn't matter enough to sway the election very much.
- The Bundling Effect
	- Imagine choosing what to buy based on pre-packaged shopping carts, that's voting for candidates.
	- Because of this, candidates don't actually know what people want from them without polling. Any one of their policies could be the thing that makes them popular with a particular demographic.
	- This is an information problem.
- Rent-seeking
	- Rent denotes unjust payment.
	- Paying off politicians to get protection from competition and things like that. Not all lobbying is rent-seeking, but much of rent-seeking is lobbying. Lobbying is protected by the constitution.

### Tax Policy
- Three things:
	- Tax base (things or activities that the government taxes)
	- Tax rate (the rate at which something in the base is taxed)
	- Tax revenues (the revenue that the government makes from taxes)
- Governments easily choose tax base and rate, they can't easily choose tax revenue.
- Taxes can be used to discourage behavior (tobacco tax), but they're mainly for revenue.
- Systems:
	- Proportional (everyone gets the same rate)
	- Progressive (brackets that scale with income)
	- Regressive (opposite of progressive, they scale with income in the reverse direction)
- Governments can, and do, change bases and rates. Federal income tax was amended to the constitutional in 1914. It was progressive from the start. The highest rate we've ever had is 94%.
- Reagan lowered tax rates and increased tax revenue.
- The Laffer Curve (discovered in the 14th century by Ibn Khaldun, but named after Arthur Laffer) is an upside-down parabola. Horizontal axis is tax rate, vertical axis is tax revenue.
	- This makes sense, because a very low tax rate doesn't make much revenue, and a very high tax rate discourages any and all behavior.
	- Optimal tax revenue isn't necessarily maximum tax revenue. For that reason, the Laffer Curve can't show us optimal tax rate, as we don't know what the optimal tax revenue is.
	- We do know that the optimal tax rate is always somewhere between 0 and the rate for maximum revenue.
- Prohibition was only possible after the income tax was put in place, as alcohol gave a lot of tax revenue. During the Great Depression, congress undid prohibition to get their tax revenue back.
- Illegal bootleggers paid for prohibition ads. They wanted alcohol to be illegal so that they wouldn't have more competition. (Bootleggers and Baptists, written by Bruce Yandle)
- The Laffer Curve can explain other things like rock climbing safety and the number of casualties it leads to.

### Ending
- Fredrick Bastiat wrote "That Which is Seen and That Which is Not Seen", which describes how economics helps us to see how the world works.

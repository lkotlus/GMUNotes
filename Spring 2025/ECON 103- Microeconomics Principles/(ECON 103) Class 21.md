### Trade Deficits/Surpluses
- We know what these are already
- When politicians talk about "bilateral trade deficits/surpluses", then we should immediately know that they have zero clue what they're talking about.
- A bilateral trade deficit is meaningless! You need to look at your trade deficit with the whole world, not just one other country!
- Assuming three countries, China, US, and Brazil:
	- US purchases 1 million in steel from China
	- China purchases 1 million in coffee from Brazil
	- Brazil purchases 1 million in lumber from US
- ***Everybody*** has a bilateral trade deficit
- ***Nobody*** has a trade deficit with the whole world
- A bilateral trade deficit means nothing because we know for a fact that everything will balance out. 
- There is no reason to assume that two countries will ever have balanced trade with one another.
- I am in a trade deficit with my supermarket. I've never had a problem with that.
- I have a trade deficit with everyone except my employer.
- Goods are tangible things, services are everything else.
- As you become richer, your demand for services goes up proportionally with your demand for services.
- Importing and exporting goods isn't the only thing we do. We also import and export services! People say that the US imports more goods than we export, and that that's a bad thing. But we export more services! We're a service sector economy.
	- Almost 80% of our economy comes from services.
	- That's what we have a comparable advantage in!
- There is a national security exception for trade.
- Free trade promotes peace, it disincentivizes wars.
	- The more you trade, the less you raid.
	- The less you trade, the more you raid.
- Doux Commerce Theorem:
	- The theorem that states that free trade promotes peace
	- There's several reasons for this
	- Trade means we talk to people, we integrate with them, and then they're no longer strange. We become friends.
	- If we're economically integrated, we're economically dependent. Don't shoot your customers, don't shoot your suppliers.
- There aren't many examples of large countries practicing fully free trade.
- John Bright and Richard Cobden started the anti corn-law league. 
	- They didn't want tariffs on grains
	- The two of them, inspired by Adam Smith and David Ricardo, saw that the price of food was higher than it should be, and they did something about it.
- President Hoover (at the beginning of the great depression) put the Smoot-Hawley tariff. It made the great depression a lot worse.
	- This worsened tensions among countries and definitely contributed to WW2. Didn't cause it, but didn't help.
- Cordell Hull pushed for reduction of global tariffs. At the start of WW2 it was 50%, it's at 2.5% now. Cordell Hull got other countries to all come together to a bargaining table. 
- 44 to 46 countries signed the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). They just mutually agreed to lower some stuff.
- GATT changed its name in 1995 to the WTO (World Trade Organization). WTO is not the UN or WHO. 
- Most countries in the world are part of a rules based global trading system. Policy is coordinated to push tariffs down. This has been done for nearly 80 years.

### Ten Foundation Stones
- The givens of economic theory
- So we have:
	1. We live in a world of inescapable scarcity (most important)
		- We can't give everyone everything at zero cost.
	2. Scarcity implies choice, which implies cost
		- You need to choose what you want, because you can't have everything you want. If you choose one thing, you lose another. What you give up when making the choice is *cost*.
		- If I go to the supermarket, there's a ton of things you would like to have. But you only have $20. Everything you want costs money, but you don't have enough money to pay for all of it. Part of your cost is the things you wanted, but did not get.
		- The actual cost of spending money is not getting to spend the money on something else you wanted. Costs are ultimately not monetary.
	3. Not all costs are expressed in terms of money, and ultimately all costs are non-monetary
		- Money is a means. If I have a billion dollars, but I'm stranded on a desert island, then I'm unbelievably poor!
		- Money makes us rich because it is a means with which we can buy products in a society where we have a great multitude of things to buy and access to buy them.
	4. People prefer more to less, human wants are unlimited
		- We will always desire more.
	5. Individuals are rational (part 1) and self-interested (part 2) (controversial)
		- Rational:
			- This doesn't mean people are like Mr. Spock or Data.
			- If someone is rational, then they have three characteristics:
				1. Act purposefully (we don't do things for no reason)
				2. Learn from their mistakes (we repeat mistakes, but we improve until we stop making them)
				3. Have preferences that are transitive (our preferences can be ordered, such that I know I prefer apples over bananas, and bananas over oranges, and so on. This also tells us that I prefer apples over oranges.)
		- Self-interested:
			- We don't mean that they only care about money, or materials, or nobody else.
			- Each person cares about themselves, friends, family, strangers, etc.
			- You have concentric circles of interest, and the closer you get to the center, the more you care.
			- You care more about certain things than other things, and the things you care more about are closer to you.
	6. Individuals respond predictably to incentives
		- Carrot and stick.
		- If I want someone to wash a dog, I can offer $500. That incentive will work for nearly anyone.
	7. Beware of unintended consequences
		- We see tons of these in economics.
		- If we make cars safer, people will drive more carelessly, and crashes will go up.
	8. Human motivation does not change when people change jobs
		- If I go from public to private sector, then I don't change. My motivations are the same.
	9. Tastes and preferences are subjective
		- Not everyone likes the same things
		- Cost-benefit, as a result, are also subjective
	10. Decisions are made at the margin (most difficult)
		- Why do we pay a lot for diamonds (useless) but very little for water (crucial)
		- The diamond-water paradox.
		- Example:
			- If I tell someone to pick between a bottle of water and a single diamond, they pick the diamond.
			- If I tell someone to pick between all the diamonds in the world or all the water in the world, they take the water.
		- In the first choice, it was either "additional diamonds" or "additional water"
		- In the latter, it was "all diamonds" or "all water"
		- Nearly all of our choices are on the margin: "a bit more" or "a bit less" of something
		- Margin definition:
			- Addition or subtraction, not all or nothing

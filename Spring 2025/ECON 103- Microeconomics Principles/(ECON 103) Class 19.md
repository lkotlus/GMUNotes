### Continuing to Refute Mercantilism
- "We don't make things anymore"
	- Wrong. Our production and capacity for production are at an all-time high.
- Share of workers in manufacturing hit an all-time high during WW2 (39%). Now we're at an all-time low in a share of workers in manufacturing at 8%.
	- This is not a problem! 
	- This is falling because the productivity has gone up. Lower workers and higher output! The same thing happened in agriculture 100 years ago.
- The net worth of nonfinancial corporate businesses is also at an all-time high
- US household income is also higher
- We have not in any way become poorer from foreign trade
